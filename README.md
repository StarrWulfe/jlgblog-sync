# jlgblog-sync
Syncing my blog here as a form of backup and conversion to Markdown and flat files. This does go the other direction into the  Wordpress served site so it could be used as the foundation of easily crafting posts from a text editor anywhere since I can pull and push/commit via Github. 

*also thinking that it could solve the issue of commenting and wordpress multi-editor colaboration...*
