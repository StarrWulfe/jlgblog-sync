# Old-Blog-Archive
## (was called "jlgblog-sync" prior to 2-9-2019)



Initially I was syncing my blog here as a form of backup and conversion to Markdown and flat files. I started keeping a blog using Blogspot (nee Google Blogger) back in 2005, then decided to migrate it over to Wordpress somewhere around 2008 to learn how to host my own instance, and also help me to use WP to operate RANmagazine's site later on. 

I used a plugin that I wound up tweaking to back the site up to my NAS as HTML files. At some point I collaborated with a few other coding hobbists and helped make a plugin for Wordpress that did the above but also could convert it over to Markdown. It could alsogo the other direction into the  Wordpress served site so it could be used as the foundation of easily crafting posts from a text editor anywhere and push into production with a git commit. 

Because this is an archive, don't expect any of the linked content to still be posted; sadly I didn't back up any of the associated media files either :cry:
