Here are all the stories I have done so far while working at <a class="zem_slink" title="Next Media Animation" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Next_Media_Animation" target="_blank" rel="wikipedia">Next Media Animation</a> in Taipei.

While being a pretty fun place to work at most of the time, I never imagined how pressured and pushed I would be creatively here. But this is not a complaint-- it's actually a *good* thing and something I feel is necessary for my growth in this field.  Everyday brings challenges in the form of making at least two original video packages about something newsworthy but more than likely lacking any visual presentation of the subject (and sometimes only vaguely outlining what happened textually as well).

This is where it's my job to try to make heads or tails out of the story, extracting its essence to put together some sort of video package, the majority of which will involve computer animation, which I almost must write the direction for as well.

I come from a broadcast TV journalism and creatives background, so I'm used to writing scripts that involve visual and aural manipulation. But with animation--the possibilities are limitless, and with my overactive imagination... Well let's just say I've learned how to be a bit more practical and not literally throw the kitchen sink in there.
