<div>I have traveled back and forth to <a class="zem_slink" title="Japan" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan" target="_blank" rel="wikipedia">Japan</a> for about 13 years now-- been fascinated with this place since I was a child, and if you ask me why-- honestly, I couldn't really explain.  I just feel more at home here, y'know? Now <a title="It’s Decided! Onward to Taipei to improve my career 決定！台湾へ成功した仕事生活のために" href="http://jlgatewood.com/2013/09/04/onward-to-taipei-to-improve-my-career/">I'm set to embark upon a new mission</a> that will carry me south onto the <a class="zem_slink" title="Geography of Taiwan" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=23.7666666667,121.0&amp;spn=0.1,0.1&amp;q=23.7666666667,121.0 (Geography%20of%20Taiwan)&amp;t=h" target="_blank" rel="geolocation">island of Taiwan</a>.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Professionally I am a journalist primarily covering East Asia and the tech sectors, and have worked in TV, film, print, radio, and multimedia/web since...well before DSL and WiFi! I love working with video and multimedia as a producer the most, but I'm happy doing anything in the <a class="zem_slink" title="New media" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_media" target="_blank" rel="wikipedia">New Media</a>realm. I was a teacher of  English and Mass Communication at a large private school in <a class="zem_slink" title="Tokyo" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=35.6895055556,139.6917&amp;spn=1.0,1.0&amp;q=35.6895055556,139.6917 (Tokyo)&amp;t=h" target="_blank" rel="geolocation">Tokyo</a>, but recently became a full-time International News Editor for <a href="http://tomonews.net" target="_blank">Tomo News</a>. Time to learn (even more) Kanji (or <a class="zem_slink" title="Chinese characters" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_characters" target="_blank" rel="wikipedia">Hanzi</a>...) and get those tones down.</div>
<div>

For fun, you can find me wandering around the nether reaches of Asia and the rest of the world with a camera, backpack, and little more than $30 on me... Who needs a hotel room when theres so much outside...outside!
