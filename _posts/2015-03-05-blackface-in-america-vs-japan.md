Over the course of the last few weeks, there has been a concerted effort to try and stop a Japanese music group from performing on TV this month, all because some members of the group perform in blackface.

There's a <a href="https://www.change.org/p/%E3%83%95%E3%82%B8%E3%83%86%E3%83%AC%E3%83%93%E3%81%AB-blackface-%E3%83%96%E3%83%A9%E3%83%83%E3%82%AF%E3%83%95%E3%82%A7%E3%82%A4%E3%82%B9-%E3%81%AE3%E6%9C%887%E6%97%A5%E6%94%BE%E9%80%81%E4%BA%88%E5%AE%9A%E3%81%AE%E8%A6%8B%E7%9B%B4%E3%81%97%E3%82%92%E6%B1%82%E3%82%81%E3%81%BE%E3%81%99-urge-fuji-tv-not-to-air-blackface-minstrel-show-on-3-7?utm_campaign=responsive_friend_inviter_chat&amp;utm_medium=facebook&amp;utm_source=share_petition&amp;recruiter=236577141" target="_blank">petition campaign</a> to try and get <a class="zem_slink" title="Fuji Television" href="http://www.fujimediahd.co.jp/en/" target="_blank" rel="homepage">Fuji Television</a> from airing their performance on this Saturday's 'Music Fair' musical TV special.

This is fine and dandy, but it's not going to change a damn thing. It's because the real problem here is not being addressed at all.

This time it is us FOREIGNERS who are imposing and impinging on Japanese custom and traditions.

In other words, WE'RE THE RACISTS!

Think about it for a second. Japanese have been performing in makeup for a MILLENNIA!

Yet when it's *WHITE* make up, we call it "beautiful and exotic."

However when we see images of Japanese in get-up like this, We tend to superimpose our own historical collective experience as African Americans, and see what we want to see.

<img class="alignright" src="http://jlgatewood.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/hqdefault.jpg" alt="" width="328" height="246" />The fact is, this group <a class="zem_slink" title="Rats &amp; Star" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rats_%26_Star" target="_blank" rel="wikipedia">Rats &amp; Star</a> along with The Chanels has been around for YEARS. As in since I was THREE YEARS OLD back in 1980. Mainly performing do-wop cuts from the 1950's, they say they perform in "brown makeup" to evoke the image of the singers they're trying to emulate as they are a cover band. To them, it's the same as when my buddy Tomohiro puts on super-tight jeans and a very loose-fitting tank top, a little lip-gloss and does his thing as '<a href="http://tomoshagger.blogspot.tw/" target="_blank">TOMO SHAGGAR</a>', when he does Rolling Stones covers in his band.

Did you also know that these guys have PERFORMED IN THE U.S. SEVERAL TIMES?   With the '<a class="zem_slink" title="Blackface" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackface" target="_blank" rel="wikipedia">BLACKFACE</a>'?

These guys are serious musicians who RESPECT BLACK CULTURE and their 'blackface' is an HOMMAGE, not a racist slap in the face.

Even their group name, 'RATS &amp; STAR' means something.
<blockquote>"Rats" raised in the less affluent parts of town could, by singing doo-wop music, reverse their fortunes and collectively become a "star".

---<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rats_%26_Star" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a></blockquote>
Now here we are, "Johnny-Come-Lately" to this 35-year-old party and think we gaijin know something.

A good friend of mine, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+BayeMcNeil" target="_blank">Baye McNeil</a> has literally started a one-man campaign against the airing of their show. Baye does know a thing or two about the passive-aggressive racism that shows its ugly head now and then in Japan. He's written a book dealing with that subject (while talking about his own racism as well) and is now manning a column in the Japan Times that talks about such things.

I normally support and side with him on many things. But on this issue, I can't completely agree that this is 'overt racism' because we again are painting our experiences on a group of people who are intrinsically unaware of the 'American Black Experience.'

<img class="alignleft" src="http://jlgatewood.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/middle_1257326541.jpg" alt="" width="318" height="249" />Forcing someone else to play by your rules while you're in their house is also bad ju-ju anyway; I'm pretty sure these guys have been asked a time or two about their blackface makeup over the course of 35 years.

Bottom line-- That show will air. The programming and the sponsors have all been booked 6 months ahead of time at the least. Fuji Television is just going to let this blow away like a whisper in the wind and a month to a year from now you're not going to hear any more of it. And why should they care? The majority of all foreigners in Japan are transients. Both Rats and Star, and Fuji TV's content is for Japanese people, not foreigners. Their sponsors advertise to Japanese people, not foreigners. We're not even on the radar.

What would be classy, and what I'm halfway expecting though is that the members of the group would explain why they wear the make-up...

<img class=" alignright" src="http://jlgatewood.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/ganguro_crop.jpg" alt="" width="488" height="555" />The other thing I think folks are missing here is the fact that 15 years ago when I first arrived in Japan, Ganguro and Yamanba girls were doing the same EXACT THING in America-mura Osaka, Sakae Nagoya, and Shibuya Tokyo. No one got pissed off at that--and I'll keep it real folks-- is because we as black guys knew this was 'code' that those girls were into BROTHAS and black culture.

Just like one man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter, one culture's history is another culture's fantasy.
