They sponsored my internship in the summer of 2002 when I was an exchange student in Japan. One of my multimedia projects was helping to develop the new online and CD-ROM based college guide and application. As part of the project, my job was to develop animations, slideshows, and flash based details. Here is the opening animation I designed for the CDROM and Flash video. It was done in After Effects.</div>
