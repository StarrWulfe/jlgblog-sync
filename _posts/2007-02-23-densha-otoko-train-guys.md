I was there this time last year, and like the last 6 years, I'll be there again for sometime this year. Never ceases to amaze me how people can have fun and do things in public that us paranoid Yanks call out the nat'l guard, SWAT, Bomb Squad, etc for... I soooo miss being over there everytime someone calls the police for things like LED battery-operated signs with cartoon characters flippin the bird.. F this place.
