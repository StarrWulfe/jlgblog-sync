You've survived O-Shogatsu, and are probably now looking forward to the end of March and the blooming of the cherry trees at this point, but there are at least 80 more days to go before seeing a single pink blossom... But did you know in Japan, Spring actually starts on February 3rd?<a href="http://japaninfoswap.com/?attachment_id=4312" rel="attachment wp-att-4312"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4312" title="setsubun comic" src="http://jlgatewood.com.previewdns.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/setsubun.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="193" /></a>
<p class="c0">Setsubun (節分) is the day before the beginning of Spring in historical Japan. The name literally means "seasonal division", but usually the term refers to the Spring Setsubun, properly called Risshun (立春) celebrated yearly on February 3 as part of the Spring Festival (春祭 haru matsuri). In its association with the Lunar New Year, Spring Setsubun can be and was previously thought of as a sort of New Year's Eve, and so was accompanied by a special ritual to cleanse away all the evil of the former year and drive away disease-bringing evil spirits for the year to come. This special ritual is called mamemaki (豆撒き, literally "bean throwing").</p>
<p class="c0">The custom of Mamemaki is still performed at most shrines and temples all over Japan (and if you have kids, you'll also notice them raving about throwing beans at their classmates really soon as elementary schools do it too!) Roasted soybeans (called "fortune beans" or 福豆 fuku mame) are thrown either out the door or at a member of the family wearing an Oni (demon or ogre) mask, while the people say "Demons out! Luck in!" (鬼は外! 福は内! Oni wa soto! Fuku wa uchi!) and slam the door.The beans are thought to symbolically purify the home by driving away the evil spirits that bring misfortune and bad health with them. Then, as part of bringing luck in, it is customary to eat roasted soybeans, one for each year of one's life, and in some areas, one for each year of one's life plus one more for bringing good luck for the year to come.</p>
<p class="c0"><a href="http://japaninfoswap.com/?attachment_id=4311" rel="attachment wp-att-4311"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-4311" title="setsubun_bean_festival" src="http://japaninfoswap.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/setsubun_bean_festival-300x172.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="172" /></a>You'll also start noticing the area convenience and grocery stores will be selling a long uncut makizushi roll called Eho-Maki (恵方巻) (lit. "lucky direction roll"). It's to be eaten in silence on Setsubun while facing the yearly lucky compass direction, determined by the zodiac symbol of that year.</p>
<p class="c0">Here are some of the more popular places to take part in the Setsubun festivities in the Tokyo area. If you live near a shrine, then you might want to check with the officials there to see if they'll have one. It's a good chance to talk to your neighbors and possibly be pelted with beans by their kids... Just be gentle with the little Onis!</p>
<p class="c0"><em><span class="c3">Senso-ji Temple</span></em></p>
<p class="c0">Perhaps the oldest organised setsubun festival happens at Tokyo's most famous temple and tourist destination. It is well known for having celebrities throwing the beans around; be sure to come early, because there's always a crowd.</p>
<p class="c0">2-3-1 Asakusa, Taito-ku, Tokyo (03 3842 0181; http://www.senso-ji.jp). Transport: Asakusa Station (Ginza, Asakusa, Tobu Isesaki lines)</p>
<p class="c0"><em><span class="c3">Tokyo Tower, Shiba Koen</span></em></p>
<p class="c0">That's right, the actual tower observation deck and not Zozoji Temple next door.  That temple's preists are joined by the tower's cone-headed Noppon mascots to toss the beans.. When they're done, you can buy some eho-maki from a stall on the same floor.</p>
<p class="c0">4-2-8 Shiba-Koen, Minato-ku, Tokyo (03 3433 5111; http://www.tokyotower.co.jp/english). Transport: Kamiyacho station (Hibiya line), Onarimon Station (Mita line) or Akebanebashi Station (Oedo line)</p>
<p class="c0"><em><span class="c3">Kanda Myojin Shrine </span></em></p>
<p class="c0">This shrine near the Akihabara area always has a big mixture of the traditional and pop culture that is Japan in its Setsubun ceremonies. The temple site is over 1200 years old, so you will have the formal ancient processions, but since Akiba is around the corner, don't be surprised to see a member of AKB48 or someone in a Gundam costume tossing beans at you.</p>
<p class="c0">2−16−2 Soto Kanda, Chiyoda, Tokyo (03-3254-0753; http://www.kandamyojin.jp) Transport: Ochanomizu station (JR Chuo/Sobu lines), Suehirocho station (Hibiya line)</p>
