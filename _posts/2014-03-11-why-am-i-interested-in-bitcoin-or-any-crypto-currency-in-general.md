There's plenty of reasons really. One major one is the fact that I stumbled upon Bitcoin as a way of collecting disaster relief donations in the wake of the <a class="zem_slink" title="2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_T%C5%8Dhoku_earthquake_and_tsunami" target="_blank" rel="wikipedia">Great East Japan Earthquake</a> and Tsunami three years ago. I was helping various charities and organizations by offering my help in translating between Japanese and English and doing press releases and logistics with other organizations. I decided to use my own PayPal account to collect some funds from friends and family back in America so they'd know exactly where their money was going. However PayPal flagged my account after doing this for about 3 months. To make a long story short, I had to refund almost US$3,000 in funds I hadn't dispersed yet. Lucky for me, I was able to get most of the funds back from those same people by working with the charities to put a bank account together to wire into, or good ol' Western Union.

That experience me scarred me though. Here I was in the middle of a disaster zone trying to funnel aid where it was needed, but I had some large faceless corporation telling ME what I can and can't do with money that was GIVEN to ME on this very website by folks who mostly have known me personally for decades... WTF?! A few months later, I was helping a friend set up a fundraising concert for Tohoku victims and I was working on a way to sell and collect tickets for the event without the hassle, and I sure as hell didn't want to deal with PayPal. One of my friends had just heard about bitcoin from his local work in software development (he knew somebody who worked with <a class="zem_slink" title="Bitcoin" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin" target="_blank" rel="wikipedia">Mt Gox</a>). That guy told me, and I spent the next 2 weeks learning how to use the stuff.

Since that time, I've been using bitcoin to help me remit money from Japan and now Taiwan back to the States to pay some bills and help my parents.
<ol>
	<li>Transferring money is really difficult. When I was living in Japan, it was tough and the wire fees were crazy, but there are companies that make it a little easier. Here in Taiwan though there's only 2 ways-- Bank wires and <a class="zem_slink" title="Western Union" href="http://www.westernunion.com/" target="_blank" rel="homepage">Western Union</a>. My bitcoin remittance method is both faster and cheaper. But instead of paying almost $50 in wire fees just to move a few hundred dollars at a time, with bitcoins, I only pay $1 on average.  And this is only because of the hit I take from buying bitcoin and selling it for dollars at the other end. It costs about 5 cents to send bitcoins anywhere-- whether you're sitting next to me, or on the other side of the planet. And the more you transfer, the less that 'fee' gets. This stuff was made for remittances.</li>
	<li>I wouldn't need to deal with money exchanges when traveling. A bitcoin in Taiwan is the same as one in Japan, is the same as one in the States. One less hassle to deal with.</li>
	<li>I don't really like dealing with paper and coins. I'm one of those folks you hear about using their <a class="zem_slink" title="Debit card" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debit_card" target="_blank" rel="wikipedia">debit card</a> to buy a 50¢ pack of gum because I only have $10 in my wallet. But that's only in the US. Here in Asia, you'd be pretty hard-pressed to find a mom-&amp;-pop store/restaurant/whatever that takes plastic. And it's all because of the fees they have to pay. The US merchant banking system makes the cost of entry (relatively) low to accept credit/debit cards, and there are things like <a class="zem_slink" title="PayPal" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PayPal" target="_blank" rel="wikipedia">PayPal</a>, <a class="zem_slink" title="Square" href="http://twitter.com/Square" target="_blank" rel="twitter">Square</a>, and Stripe. But that ain't gonna happen at a night market in Taipei. Cash or GTFO. <a class="zem_slink" title="Bitcoin" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin" target="_blank" rel="wikipedia">Bitcoin</a> could change that if it can take root, because there's little to no startup cost, infinitesimally small <a class="zem_slink" title="Fee" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fee" target="_blank" rel="wikipedia">transaction fees</a>, and it's not dependent on any central company to support.</li>
	<li>I could actually SAVE my money and be rewarded for it! Since BTC is a deflationary currency, it will grow in value over time. Somthing like interest!</li>

I've heard from other seasoned Bitcoiners that the only way to truly enjoy the benefits of the BTC economy is to stay in it without needing to convert to/from fiat... So I'm going to try to start a small freelance business that will only pay me in BTC. I know already that my internet hosting fees (domain, website hosting, VPS, <a class="zem_slink" title="Virtual private network" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_network" target="_blank" rel="wikipedia">VPN</a>, etc) accept bitcoin; that's how I've paid them for the past 2 months actually. Let's see what else I can spend it on...
