<p>I remember my granny taking my cousin Shannon and I to choir practice when we were little and playing this song in her brand new Lincoln Town Car.  I remember thinking "this is the song we SHOULD be singing this Easter."  The children's choir sang a different song, "The Center of my Joy".  But the Ladies' choir (including my granny) sang this one. And they sang it joyously.  Etta, you'll be missed. </p><ul><li><img src="http://s2.googleusercontent.com/s2/favicons?domain=www.youtube.com" alt="jiffy-icon" width="16" height="16" /></li><li>Source: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oma9nsPimqI" muse_scanned="true">YouTube</a></li></ul><div><iframe width="460" height="259" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/oma9nsPimqI?wmode=opaque&fs=1&feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div>
