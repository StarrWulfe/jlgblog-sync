But Mark McGwire is a BASEBALL PLAYER... Who QUIT right after that season!! </span></div><p /><div><span style="font-size: 11px;">Well it's no wonder-- He spilled the beans yesterday about his steroid use during that season!  So I'm in favor of at the very least, getting the Missouri Department of Transportation to rename I-70 back to Mark Twain Expwy.   </span></div><p /><div><span style="font-size: 11px;">Do I think he was genuine in apologizing?  Yes.  Do I feel bad? As a Cardinals fan, yes I do, but since that time we went on to win 3 pennants, and win one World Series!  So I am still proud to wear my Cards jerseys here in Japan!   But when I go back home to the States this spring and drive I-70-- I want that damn sign DOWN!!</span></div><p /><div><span style="font-size: 11px;"><img src="http://posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/starrwulfe/bJdcbpbqdsGuEtCunxxyehAqxpIBJqqEgDddlxrmtJtDHuGEIgGBGpkDrtxD/media_httpimagesstlto_dmhGc.jpg.scaled500.jpg" width="460" height="320" /> </span></div><p style="font-size: 9px;">  Posted via email from <a href="http://starrwulfe.info/can-mark-twain-have-i-70-naming-rights-back-n">...all about starrwulfe...</a>  </p></div>
