With the proliferation of Wi-Fi capable smartphones in Japan, it was only a matter of time before a train company put this technology to good use.

Enter "TrainNet", Japan Railway's moniker for the new service. The concept is simple. Install Wi-Fi routers in every train car that can serve up-to-date information on delays, services, maps, and so on, while the train is in motion. Most Tokyo area trains already have LCD monitors above the doors that show information for upcoming stations, news, and advertising. This is an extension of that.

Right now, JR has been testing one train with the service on the Yamanote Line since late summer. The outside and inside of the train has posters showing the service is being tested and invites you to try it.

Once aboard, simply look for the Trainnet SSID in your smartphone's Wi-Fi settings then open a web browser. Use your email address to log in and fill out an optional survey and you're in.

At the top of every screen there's the next stop for the train you're riding in and it updates as you move along. Also schedules, station services and more can be viewed.

My only gripe is that this is all in Japanese for now. I hope they make it bilingual after the test phase is complete. It will help tourists and non-Japanese speakers navigate Japan with ease.

If the trial is successful, JR-East plans to announce which train lines will be the first to receive the tech sometime in mid 2013.
