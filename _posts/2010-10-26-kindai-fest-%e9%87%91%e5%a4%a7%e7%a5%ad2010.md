[gallery link="file" orderby="rand"]<br /><br />So I went to the Kinjo university <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">nampa</span> festival. Schools from elementary on up to university have a day where they open their doors to the public and the students perform their particular talents they've been studying. Being that Kinjo is an all-girls' academy, there were more guys trying to hook up than I've seen in a long time! (me included! :))
