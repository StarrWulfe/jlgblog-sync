>I got this email this morning from Obama's promo camp (as you know, I did a little work on his campaign last year)<div><div></div><blockquote type="cite"><div> <table width="100%"> <tr><td style="padding: 10px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Verdana, Helvetica sans-serif;" width="90%">Jason --<p /> This morning, Michelle and I awoke to some surprising and humbling news. At 6 a.m., we received word that I'd been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for 2009.<p /> To be honest, I do not feel that I deserve to be in the company of so many of the transformative figures who've been honored by this prize -- men and women who've inspired me and inspired the entire world through their courageous pursuit of peace.<p /> But I also know that throughout history the Nobel Peace Prize has not just been used to honor specific achievement; it's also been used as a means to give momentum to a set of causes.<p /> That is why I've said that I will accept this award as a call to action, a call for all nations and all peoples to confront the common challenges of the 21st century. These challenges won't all be met during my presidency, or even my lifetime. But I know these challenges can be met so long as it's recognized that they will not be met by one person or one nation alone.<p /> This award -- and the call to action that comes with it -- does not belong simply to me or my administration; it belongs to all people around the world who have fought for justice and for peace. And most of all, it belongs to you, the men and women of America, who have dared to hope and have worked so hard to make our world a little better.<p /> So today we humbly recommit to the important work that we've begun together. I'm grateful that you've stood with me thus far, and I'm honored to continue our vital work in the years to come.<p /> Thank you,<p /> President Barack Obama <br /></td><td><br /></td></tr></table></div></blockquote><br /></div><div>I'm in awe-- the outgoing president IMHO helped further tangle us in worldwide confusion, made it this easy for the next sitting president who has a doctorine completely opposite, to make this sort of achievement. While I am glad for Obama to have won, I think they should have waited until the end of his term as president to bestow the honor. While chances are slim, what if he suddenly changed his stance on afganistan and bombed them into the stone age?Would they resend the award?  I don't think a sitting president should get an award like this without having either made some serious achievement (think the end to aparthied in South Africa and Mandela) or wait till he's outta office like Jimmy Carter.  </div><p /><div>What do you think, am I being too strict on this issue?  Do you feel the same way about it?  </div>      <p style="font-size: 8px;">  <a href="http://posterous.com">Posted via email</a>   from <a href="http://starrwulfe.posterous.com/obama-gets-nobel-peace-award">...all about starrwulfe...</a>  </p>
