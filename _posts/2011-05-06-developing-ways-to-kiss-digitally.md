Because in Japan, we believe EVERYTHING should have the ability to be sent electronically...  And you know if they're working on sending kisses through the internet, they've got 2nd, and 3rd base under R&D as we speak.  Ever see a movie called "Cherry 2000"?<br /><blockquote><span style="color: #444444; font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px;"> </span><br /><br />“This device is for communications within the mouth, in other words, the goal is to obtain the feeling of kissing.”<br /><br />“If you take one device in your mouth and turn it with your tongue, the other device turns in the same way. If you turn it back the other way, then your partner’s turns back the same way, so your partner’s device turns whichever way your own device turns.”<br /><br />“For example, if you have a popular entertainer use this device and record it, that could be hugely popular if you offer it to fans.”<br /><br />“The elements of a kiss include the sense of taste, the manner of breathing, and the moistness of the tongue. If we can recreate all of those I think it will be a really powerful device.”</blockquote><br /></div><br /> <br /><br /></div>
