I'm not gonna sugarcoat this post, or make it all eloquent and politically correct... I'm gonna write stream-of-consiousness now, for those who care (and I assume if you're reading past this point, you must care a little.)

I'm jovial. Downright happy... I'm scared but very excited, and more so than I have been in a while. I'm MOVING.  And it's a big move... I'm headed to...

TOKYO!<a name="more"></a>

In December of 2010, a friend tweeted me and said his company was looking for a multimedia guy who was wise to the ways of Nihon and elsewhere.  I immediately dropped everything and scrounged my last 20,000 yen and drove up to <a class="zem_slink" title="Tokyo" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=35.6895055556,139.6917&amp;spn=1.0,1.0&amp;q=35.6895055556,139.6917 (Tokyo)&amp;t=h" rel="geolocation" target="_blank">Tokyo</a> from Nagoya. I was told I got the job about a month or so later...  And immediately the gratification of this whole "being in Japan on a wing and a prayer" swept over me...  Maybe you don't know my story of how I ended up here in Japan (everyone has one--nobody comes to Japan from the States, Canada, Oz, Europe...no one comes here without some sort of story.) Well you only have to go as far back as the archives will take you to see how I got here.  <a href="http://j7is.me/a8mJhX" target="_blank">Here's a start...</a>

Anyway, I've been over here for 2 1/2 years working as an English teacher in the <a class="zem_slink" title="Nagoya" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=35.1814555556,136.906386111&amp;spn=0.1,0.1&amp;q=35.1814555556,136.906386111 (Nagoya)&amp;t=h" rel="geolocation" target="_blank">Nagoya city</a> public schools under contract.  But my heart (as you can tell by my continuous rants on technology) is still in the Multimedia/IT/Tech field.  I miss doing tech news, and I miss creating video and animation...  and I most DEFINITELY miss the decent pay that came along with it.  I've had to work 3 jobs in order to have a decent life and pay back student loans and stuff here-- it's been a struggle.  But then again, no matter how hard it's been, I could always point to the fact that back home I was laid off of 3 jobs in 3 years there due to the economy, mergers, or downsizing.  At least here I had the SAME 3 jobs non-stop.

Anyway, one door is closing and another one is opening.  I've had some great times in Nagoya.  You know, it wasn't my first choice in cities to live in Japan...  I'm still more partial to <a class="zem_slink" title="Osaka" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=34.6938888889,135.502222222&amp;spn=0.1,0.1&amp;q=34.6938888889,135.502222222 (Osaka)&amp;t=h" rel="geolocation" target="_blank">Osaka</a> actually--but it's probably more to do with nostalgia than anything...  Nagoya has become home and its the city that's big enough to have a lot of people, and small enough to know everyone in it. There's great things happening here with the ex-pat community, and it seems like the natives are getting used to us foreign guys in town... A lot of us ain't goin' nowhere else; we have families and we pay taxes off in this piece-- we gotta right to be here too!  I hope Nags stays on course... But I'm outta here in a few days...

I'll be living in Yokohama and working in Tokyo-- Gotanda in Minato ward if you're up on Tokyo geography. The office atmosphere is very relaxed but very hard-working; even though there's a beer tap and a darts board on the premises. The commute is easy as well-- I'll be living a short 5 minute walk to the train station and can be wisked to work on one train in under 30 minutes. Not the typical Tokyo commute at all actually-- some people endure hour-long commutes on crush-capacity trains, and may have to transfer a bunch of times to make their final destinations...  I got lucky.  My rent is slightly more than it is now but I have a much bigger place too... I got REAL lucky.  Some friends in the know asked why wasn't I looking to live in the middle of Tokyo...  For the same reason I didn't live in the middle of Nagoya, Osaka or even <a class="zem_slink" title="Atlanta" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=33.755,-84.39&amp;spn=0.1,0.1&amp;q=33.755,-84.39 (Atlanta)&amp;t=h" rel="geolocation" target="_blank">Atlanta</a>-- it's a deterrent to spending all my money hanging out. Living in-town means I can be at some bar drinking til well after last-train (around 12am) and know I can get home by walking... This way I'll have to be on that train and have my ass outta Dodge and in the bed so I can make it to work the next day.  And knowing my lazy streak, some days, I may not even leave my lil' area in Yokohama-- just like I don't leave my lil part of <a class="zem_slink" title="Chikusa-ku, Nagoya" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chikusa-ku%2C_Nagoya" rel="wikipedia" target="_blank">Chikusa</a> ward here now.  It's cheaper and more relaxing sometimes just to be around the 'hood.

Gotta admit--I'm kinda scared. What if this falls through? What if I get laid off? What if the people there don't like me? The hell with it... This is STILL Japan, and I am STILL a pioneer on a mission.  And I am STILL on SCHEDULE.  Ain't no stoppin' me now, I'm on the move!!
