They go and invent something like this.  I ♥ nerds.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.osnews.com/story/25594/Tribler_makes_BitTorrent_impossible_to_shut_down">Tribler makes BitTorrent impossible to shut down</a><br /><blockquote>"While the file-sharing ecosystem is currently filled with uncertainty and doubt, researchers at <a title="Delft University of Technology" href="http://www.tudelft.nl/en" rel="homepage">Delft University of Technology</a> continue to work on their decentralized BitTorrent network. Their Tribler client doesn't require torrent sites to find or download content, as it is based on pure <a title="Peer-to-peer" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer-to-peer" rel="wikipedia">peer-to-peer</a> communication. 'The only way to take it down is to take the Internet down,' the lead researcher says."</blockquote><br />Take <strong><em>THAT</em></strong> you would-be SOPA-PIPA lovers. When will you get a damn clue? Remember what happened to the music industry BEFORE the iPod? It's gonna happen again with video now... as speeds and technologies get better and faster, PEOPLE will find a way to enjoy the content that's being produced somehow ON THEIR TERMS, and NOT YOURS.  If you want to remain relevant, then find a way to make money off of it, not by beating a dead horse, but by INNOVATING. You're just pissing people like me off when you shut down sites like Megaupload and Filepost--sites that I used LEGALLY to store my content within the bounds of <a title="Fair use" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use" rel="wikipedia">FAIR USE</a>. When we get pissed off, we end up downloading programs like these and getting what we want ON PURPOSE.<br /><br />Think about it--before this happened, no one really knew about Tribler. Now even here in JAPAN people talk about it and use it-- so much so that the team's website has been stripped of nothing more than download links because so many people are getting it... Y'all caused it, not us.  DEAL WITH IT.<br /><h6 style="font-size: 1em;">Related articles</h6><br /><ul><br />	<li><a href="http://www.geek.com/articles/news/unlike-megaupload-tribler-bittorrent-client-can-never-be-taken-down-2012028/">Unlike Megaupload, Tribler Bittorrent client can never be taken down</a> (geek.com)</li><br />	<li><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2098759/Tribler-New-file-sharing-technology-IMMUNE-government-attacks.html?ITO=1490">Tribler: New file-sharing technology is IMMUNE to government attacks</a> (dailymail.co.uk)</li><br />	<li><a href="http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/news/2012/02/in-world-of-copyright-craziness-bittorrent-inc-soars-to-new-heights.ars">In world of copyright craziness, BitTorrent, Inc. soars to new heights</a> (arstechnica.com)</li><br />	<li><a href="http://www.bgr.com/2012/02/10/unstoppable-file-sharing-network-tribler-spells-trouble-for-copyright-holders/">Unstoppable file-sharing network 'Tribler' spells trouble for copyright holders</a> (bgr.com)</li><br /></ul><br /><div style="margin-top: 10px; height: 15px;"><a title="Enhanced by Zemanta" href="http://www.zemanta.com/"><img class="zemanta-pixie-img" style="float: right;" src="http://img.zemanta.com/zemified_e.png?x-id=4adbeaff-35f6-4c7b-bc46-4a5f970a148c" alt="Enhanced by Zemanta" /></a></div>
