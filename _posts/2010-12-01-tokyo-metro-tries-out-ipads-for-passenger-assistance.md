Remember the video I posted about the iPads in some Tokyo taxis to help foreigners cross the language barrier?  Looks like Tokyo Metro (one of the subway operators in the metropolis) is using Apple's appliance to do the same...<a name='more'></a><br /><blockquote><a href="http://www.tokyometro.jp/news/2010/p...ws20101125.pdf" target="_blank">Press release</a><br /><img src="http://www.jlgatewood.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/metronews20101125.jpg" alt="Tokyo Metro information rep with iPad and customer" /><br /><br />At Tōkyō Metro (HQ: Taitō Ward, Tōkyō; President: Umezaki Hisashi), starting Wednesday, December 1, 2010 we will introduce iPads on a trial basis at Ginza Station and Omotesandō Station for use by Service Managers when assisting passengers with information and directional guidance needs.<br /><br />Currently, Tōkyō Metro’s Service Managers provide customers with railway-related information and information about areas surrounding stations using paper-based resources stored in file. With the introduction of the iPad units, it is now possible to zoom in and display digitalized versions of these resources on an iPad screen, and using the wireless LAN inside train stations, use map information and other data on the Internet to provide assistance to passengers. As a result, we will now be able to provide more intelligent and more comprehensive guidance for passengers.<br /><br />In addition, our Foreign Language Translation Service, implemented since August of this year, will also make use of iPad units. In these cases, the customer, the Service Manager, and the translation service operator can simultaneously hold a conversation, streamlining out translation service even further.<br /><br />The iPad trial program will last until the end of the fiscal year, after which we will consider expansion of the program in the future. At Tōkyō Metro, we will strive for further improvements to customer service into the future.<br /><br />About Service Managers<br /><br />Service Managers are a guidance service provided by Tōkyō Metro, and were first introduced in April 2004 as a means of ensuring a comfortable travel experience for elderly passengers and passengers unfamiliar with the subway.<br /><br />Service Managers are deployed during the midday period (10:00 to 17:00) at 14 high-ridership stations (primarily in the vicinity of faregates and ticketing halls), providing information and guidance to passengers while moving through the stations.<br /><br />About Tōkyō Metro’s Foreign Language Translation Service<br /><br />With the forecasted increase in foreign passengers in the future and the need to ensure adequate communication with passengers despite language barriers, Tōkyō Metro introduced a foreign language translation service on August 9 of this year that allows Tōkyō Metro employees to connect over telephone with a call center at a translation service company and have an operator assist in translation (implemented at station offices, commuter pass ticketing locations, travel information centers, and lost-and-found locations, and with Service Managers). As a result, assisting passengers from overseas with station facilities and directions on transferring trains, as well as responding to lost-and-found requests, has been streamlined.<br /><br />The service is provided in English, Chinese, and Korean, and is available from 9:00 to 22:00.<br /><br />via <a href="http://www.skyscrapercity.com/showthread.php?t=828904&page=96">SkyscraperCity's Quashlo.</a></blockquote><br />Now that's using some cool tech to solve a real problem. I hope it also means that the iPad (and tablets/smartphones in general) will be seen now as a tool to have in Japan just like a regular keitai...
