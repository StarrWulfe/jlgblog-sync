Driving in Japan presents its own set of challenges for those of us used to roadways and traffic patterns back home; of course the most obvious for us Yanks, and those from The Contienent is that the traffic moves on the left side of the road (of course the Brits and those from "down under" are used to this) But also we must get used to sudden double-parking, very narrow streets, and very tight quarters in car parks.

Winter is especially tough going here in Nippon. Even those of us very seasoned to driving in wintery conditions will find it rough going when the snow starts to fly, or when driving through the mountains during mid winter. Here are some useful tips to remember if you're new to winter driving here.
<h4>SNOW TIRES AND CHAINS</h4>
I'm from St. Louis, Missouri, USA, and we get a decent amount of snow every year, but there is one thing that we do that most of Japan doesn't do, and that's salt and plow the roads. This means If you are used to “all-weather” tires in your home country - BEWARE!  You may find your car unable to get up even the smallest incline on a cold, snowy day.  Snow tires or chains are imperative for winter driving in Japan!  In metro Tokyo, Nagoya or Osaka, you may get away with not needing snow tires, but I'd still recommend a set of chains to keep in the trunk. Especially if you're prone to driving to ski resorts or freak snow storms hit your neck of the woods.
<h4>GASOLINE</h4>
Make sure to drive with no more than 1/3 of a tank of gas or more when plying the roads in winter. Chances are if you become stuck in the snow somehow, you'll appreciate having the reserve gas to keep the car's engine going along with the heater to keep you warm.
<h4>SNOW REMOVAL KIT</h4>
This can be as simple as keeping a small windshield ice scraper, brush and foldable shovel in the trunk as well. You'll also notice how Japanese people will fold their wiper blades away from the glass if they know snow or freezing rain will hit. This prevents the blades from cracking and makes it easy to deice the windshield later. Also my tip: Keep a bag of kitty litter in the car to use as traction if you get stuck with a sliding driving wheel. That bag of "cat sand" has saved me dozens of times both in the States and here in Japan.
<h4>OTHER ACCESSORIES</h4>
You can't go anywhere if you can't see, and your car needs good wipers; if you want to err on the side of caution, grab a new set every fall before the snow hits. Also make sure to keep a full tank of windshield washer fluid with a winter-mix formulation, because winter windshields can get nasty in a hurry.

If your vehicle is rear-wheel-drive, you may want to add some weight in the trunk or  cargo bed, since the drive wheels have superior traction when there's weight above them.

Don't forget about yourself either. Sunglasses? Need 'em; glare off the snow is about the worst you'll ever encounter. Make sure you've got gloves handy in case you have to use that scraper. Don't wear enormous boots if you can help it, as you want your feet to be nimble on the pedals for changing road conditions. Your margin for error is a lot slimmer than usual when the roads are slick, so this stuff matters more than you might think.
<h4>THE ROCKING TECHNIQUE</h4>
So what happens when you do find yourself stuck in a patch of slippery ice?  Try to rock your way out.  The trick here is to avoid flooring the accelerator and hoping that copious wheel spin will get the job done. In fact, it will just dig you into an even deeper hole. Try the "rocking chair" technique. See if you can get the car to move just an inch in either direction-try going forward first, and if that doesn't work, switch to reverse. Any movement? Good, then you can start up the rocking chair. Rock as far as you can in that initial direction, and then take your foot off the gas and let the car roll back. When the momentum swings back again, give it a little gas, then let up?and so on. If you find it tough going, use the kitty litter around the wheel that is spinning. With any luck, you'll get a nice rocking chair going, and eventually you'll rock your way right out of being stuck.
