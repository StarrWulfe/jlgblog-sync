The 3rd ending of the series actually made up of 13 different closing videos; one for each squad division.  Someone did a great job of taking the original full song from the closing theme (Houki Boushi by Youna-- I think I'll post the PV later, she's cute!) and combining all 13 endings into one.  Enjoy!
