[youtube 4eJ0zuXIkwo]<br /><div><br /><div><br /><div>via <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eJ0zuXIkwo&feature=player_embedded">youtube.com</a></div><br />All my ATLiens, and Derrrtys from the Lou wanna know whats up with this city called Nagoya I happen to be in...  They've heard of Tokyo, and maybe even Osaka...  But Nag-Town ain't even on the map...  Even with it's 5 million living in Aichi Prefecture, 2.3 million in the city limits...  At least my pops knew this is where Toyota is based...<br />This is where I stay right now. The N.  Nag dayo.<br />...Not exactly as fire as the ATL in some ways, but it's still fly in its own way...<br /><br />So sit back and relax as Man tells y'all about the city you've never heard of in Japan.<br />After 2 years and some change here... Well I know all the streets in this video, and take both those subways everyday...  You might squint towards the end and see me maybe....maybe not.  But it wouldn't surprise me.<br /><br /><img src="http://www.jlgatewood.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/default.jpg" alt="Man-Nagoya State of Mind on Youtube" /><br /><br /></div><br /></div>
