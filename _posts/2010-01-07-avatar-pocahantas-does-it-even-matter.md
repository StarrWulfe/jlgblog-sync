But let's be honest.  This Pocahantas type storyline has been played out in varying forms since humans could communicate a narrative to each other.... </p><p>The Last Samurai <br />Titanic <br />The New World <br />Dances With Wolves <br />Tristan and Isolde <br />Romeo and Juliet <br />Star Wars </p><p>In each of the above, you'll find the basic "outsider was meant to conquer, but joined the group and became a freedom fighter" storyline. </p><p>Enough.  Avatar was just good dammit.  F that, it was great!  And I happen to LIKE these types of story-lines every so often.  So it had holes in it, or was too fanciful.  Uhh, newsflash, it was a story about 10 foot tall blue cat aliens on a moon orbiting a blue version of Jupiter!!</p></div> <p style="font-size: 10px;"> <a href="http://posterous.com">Posted via web</a>  from <a href="http://starrwulfe.info/avatar-pocahantas-does-it-even-matter">...all about starrwulfe...</a> </p>
