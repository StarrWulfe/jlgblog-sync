&gt;My horoscope on February 1st said, "Virgo: You are dreaming of a faraway place. Go where your dreams direct you."

Its true. I'm constantly wanting to be somewhere other than where I am now. In fact anyone who knows me doesn't have to guess where I really want to be. Question is how can I get back to where I wanna be?

Today my horoscope was more insistant... "You're dreaming of a faraway place. You'll never get there if you don't start moving."

Consider me to have shifted into 5th, afterburners full glow, and moving full speed ahead then.

Someday I will be riding my BMW F800 on the <a class="zem_slink" title="Hanshin Expressway" href="http://www.hanshin-exp.co.jp/" rel="homepage" target="_blank">Hanshin Expressway</a> in <a class="zem_slink" title="Osaka" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osaka" rel="wikipedia" target="_blank">Osaka</a>. And I will be on my way home from another day in my life. I will make it back there. I will make it back to Japan, my other home.
