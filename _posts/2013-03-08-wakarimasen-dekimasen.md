In Japanese, this means "I don't know about it, therefore it cannot be done." or rather, "since I have never heard of this before, it must not even exist in the realm of time and space we currently occupy, thereby making your request moot, improbable, and impossible. Scram."

Recently I was <del>discussing complaining</del> bitching aboutÂ some screwy inconvience "Life-In-Japan" had thrown me, and one of my co-workers told me about this phrase. He then directed me to his website, "<a href="http://www.crazyjapan.com" target="_blank">Crazy In Japan</a>" where I found a good explanation of what this meant, which he's graciously allowed me to share here... Enjoy, and if you're here in Japan--become enlightened.
<blockquote>After several months in Japan, you walk into the local branch of Some Generic Bank. The clerk you've dealt with for the past several months has been replaced by a fresh faced young woman (most bank clerks seem to be female). You pass over your yen traveller's checks only to hear a loud sucking of teeth from the fresh faced clerk as she examines them front and back. She looks at you, frowns and says "Wait a moment please." When she returns, she explains, in broken English, that they can't cash the checks here. You'll have to go someplace else. You explain that you've done this dozens of times at this very bank. She repeats "It can't be done." You walk out, frustrated and broke.

Congratulations. You've just encountered wakarimasen dekimasen.

Literally, this means "I don't understand. I can't do it." but your humble editor has expanded it to include the notion "I don't understand it. It can't be done."

This phenomenon seems to stem from the notion of "saving face." In the Some Generic Bank case, the fresh faced clerk doesn't know what to do, and rather than ask for help, she quickly looks for written instructions. Failing to find them, she determines that it can't be done. Or, the fresh faced clerk, not understanding what you want to do, explains it badly to someone in charge, only to be told it can't be done.

In such cases, all you can do is look frantically around for the clerk who used to handle your checks. Failing to find her, you might as well go away and come back later. Explaining you've done this before will only make the "face saving" more important to the fresh faced clerk and increase her denials. Once she's declared that what you want to do is impossible, it will be too embarrassing for her to backtrack. Also, if you ask to speak to a manager, the manager will, more than likely, side with the fresh faced clerk to save her further public embarrassment, or will drag out the process as long as possible in the hope that you will go away.

The next time you go to Some Generic Bank, the same fresh faced clerk will process your yen traveller's checks with no questions asked.</blockquote>
