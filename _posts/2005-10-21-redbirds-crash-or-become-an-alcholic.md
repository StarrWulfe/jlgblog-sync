>Well the redbirds tried...  But in the end, the Astros won 4 games to 2 to end the NLCS.  Now its Chicago White Sox vs. Houston Astros.  I got a buddy from Houston; he's been using the NLCS to poke fun at me, but at a friend's wedding this past weekend he was wondering if I've become a bit of a lush...  The reception had an open bar, and I took that opportunity to have 3 bloody marys in a row...  Then with the Cards making the post-season, and my 40" screen TV not working, I've been going to the local sports bar on game nights.  Of course while Im there I have to have beer...  and at $3 for 2 pints, well I do get loaded sometimes...  They have 35 cent chicken wings though...  Anyway last night I watched the first half of what would be the end of the line for St Lou, and I ordered 2 beers....  Ate a chicken sandwich...  and then at the end of the 5th inning got up to leave.  Ryan, the barkeep, says "leavin so soon?  What's goin on, you can put away 2 more..."  That's when I started thinking...  Im becoming Norm Peterson off of <span style="font-style: italic;">Cheers</span>!  I have my certian spot I sit at the bar...  I order the same things; 5 lemon pepper, 5 garlic spicy, an order of cheese fries, and a tall cold one...  ...not healthy either, but I usually do this once a week...  But last week I was there 3 days outta seven...  So now I feel guilty...  And yeah, maybe I am a borderline drunk...  But at least I can hold my liquor!
