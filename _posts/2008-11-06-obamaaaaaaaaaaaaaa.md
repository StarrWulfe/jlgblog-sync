Over here in Japan, I was told by by students that Obama had won.  See here in Japan, the polls closed at around 12 noon...  So I was in the middle of a lesson.  As soon as it was over, one of my students checked the internet and ran back yelling "Sensei, Sensei!!! Obama katsushitaaaaaa!!"  Which means "Teacher, Teacher, Obama woooooooon!!!"<br /><br />I actually got emotional, and had to try to explain to the kids around me what this meant.  But this has been all over the news-- just today I woke up and watched NHK news and they dedicated 20 minutes to the American presidential race (most of it talking about Obama actually)  I think the Japanese like Obama more than McCain for the same reasons that most of the world does-- He symbolizes home and change for the better.   My students certainly know-- they asked me who did I vote for when I first got here.  I said "Obama", and they say "yokatta na"-- "That's good isnt it?"    Yes it is.<br /><br />The picture BTW is of me and some fellow teachers from other schools I ran into-- some have "I &lt;3 Obama" on their faces!!
