The following aren't my words, but in light of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011%20Tucson%20shooting">shootings that took place in Tucson, Arizona on 8 January, 2011</a>, I feel they must be echoed.<br /><br />I'm going to talk about controversy, by posting the opinion of a very controversial group as of late, WikiLeaks.  If you have no clue of whom I speak of, please check their tweets by following @wikileaks, since they get their website shut down all the time for obvious reasons...<br /><br />Again, the following are NOT my words, but I do share the opinion expressed within; take it for what you will...<br /><blockquote>via: http://www.twitlonger.com/show/82g3kb<br /><br />WIKILEAKS PRESS RELEASE<br />10 Jan 2010, 10:15 PM EST<br /><br />“WikiLeaks: treat incitement seriously or expect more Gabrielle Gifford killing sprees.”<br /><br />Wikileaks today offered sympathy and condolences to the victims of the Tucson shooting together with best wishes for the recovery of U.S. Representative Gabrielle Giffords. Giffords, a democrat from Arizona's 8th district, was the target of a shooting spree at a Jan 8 political event in which six others were killed.<br /><br />Tucson Sheriff Clarence Dupnik, leading the investigation into the Gifford shooting, said that "vitriolic rhetoric" intended to "inflame the public on a daily basis ... has [an] impact on people, especially who are unbalanced personalities to begin with." Dupnik also observed that officials and media personalities engaging in violent rhetoric "have to consider that they have some responsibility when incidents like this occur and may occur in the future."<br /><br />WikiLeaks staff and contributors have also been the target of unprecedented violent rhetoric by US prominent media personalities, including Sarah Palin, who urged the US administration to “Hunt down the WikiLeaks chief like the Taliban”. Prominent US politician Mike Huckabee called for the execution of WikiLeaks spokesman Julian Assange on his Fox News program last November, and Fox News commentator Bob Beckel, referring to Assange, publicly called for people to "illegally shoot the son of a bitch." US radio personality Rush Limbaugh has called for pressure to "Give [Fox News President Roger] Ailes the order and [then] there is no Assange, I'll guarantee you, and there will be no fingerprints on it.", while the Washington Times columnist Jeffery T. Kuhner titled his column “Assassinate Assange” captioned with a picture Julian Assange overlayed with a gun site, blood spatters, and “WANTED DEAD or ALIVE” with the alive crossed out.<br /><br />John Hawkins of Townhall.com has stated "If Julian Assange is shot in the head tomorrow or if his car is blown up when he turns the key, what message do you think that would send about releasing sensitive American data?"<br /><br />Christian Whiton in a Fox News opinion piece called for violence against WikiLeaks publishers and editors, saying the US should "designate WikiLeaks and its officers as enemy combatants, paving the way for non-judicial actions against them."<br /><br />WikiLeaks spokesman Julian Assange said: "No organisation anywhere in the world is a more devoted advocate of free speech than Wikileaks but when senior politicians and attention seeking media commentators call for specific individuals or groups of people to be killed they should be charged with incitement -- to murder. Those who call for an act of murder deserve as significant share of the guilt as those raising a gun to pull the trigger."<br /><br />“WikiLeaks has many young staff, volunteers and supporters in the same geographic vicinity as these the broadcast or circulation of these incitements to kill. We have also seen mentally unstable people travel from the US and other counties to other locations. Consequently we have to engage in extreme security measures.”<br /><br />“We call on US authorities and others to protect the rule of law by aggressively prosecuting these and similar incitements to kill. A civil nation of laws can not have prominent members of society constantly calling for the murder and assassination of other individuals or groups.”<br /><br />More examples:<br /><br />http://www.peopleokwithmurderingassange.com/<br /><br />END</blockquote><br />I can't agree more. Look, I'm from the U.S. of A. While I don't bleed red white and blue, I DO bleed red... And my ancestors bleed red on that land for generations. I'm a Libertarian, and I believe in the right to CIVIL discourse and CIVIL disagreement... I got to see a full-blown RIOT and civil disorder when I was 13 years old in 1992... <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1992%20Los%20Angeles%20riots">The L.A. Riots</a>... It took 4 days and whole neighborhoods burning down to stop the unrest-- all because for so long, a segment of the population wasn't heard...  How about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effects%20of%20Hurricane%20Katrina%20in%20New%20Orleans">2005--Hurricane Katrina</a>? How about the political blame-go-round that's happening now in the wake of 2 wars that really aren't solving much in the way of problems, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late-2000s%20recession">worst worldwide economic downturn since the Great Depression</a>, and <a href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/weblogsinc/gadling/~3/YcXfJ3SLKdg/">weird happenings on a global scale</a>?  People... Please wake up... Take a chill pill, and look around you. Something is happening... I can't tell you what it is, but I feel it. There's 9 billion of us on this planet now, and we need to learn how to get along with each other... Not just as a nation; hell I live in Japan right now-- but as a HUMAN RACE. We are supposed to be the protectors of this planet, our HomeWorld. Let's find a way to break down barriers, share a little, give a little, and make sure our kids, kid's kids, and so on, can have something when we're dead and gone from here...<br /><br />☮
