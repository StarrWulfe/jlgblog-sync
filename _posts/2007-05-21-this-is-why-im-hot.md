>Current mood: <img src="http://www.jlgatewood.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/annoyed.gif" align="absmiddle" /> annoyed<br /><br />...because its 80 fu#king degrees in my apartment! I'm getting to know my local starbucks on an intimate basis due to my air conditioner being broken and the people that run the tenement/refugee camp/shithole of an apartment complex don't give a damn. They can kiss the fattest part of my ass anyway, i'm moving this friday to a better, more centrally located spot anyhow. ...until then, ill be letting my engine idle in the parking lot-- i still got air in my car you bitches!
