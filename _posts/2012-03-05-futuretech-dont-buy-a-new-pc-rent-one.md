Ever since I made the move to a Windows-free computing environment at home 4 years ago, things have been painless 90% of the time, but there's times when I NEED a PC running windows to perform some task... Things like:<br /><ul><br />	<li>While touching up some Powerpoint slides, Keynote screws the formatting up on export.</li><br />	<li>Getting .XLS files that have pivot tables, and Excel specific formatting and formulas; can't use Numbers here.</li><br />	<li>When I need to make changes to previous documents done in Word, and don't want to totally reformat the whole document for just one change. Can't use Pages.</li><br />	<li>Websites that insist on using <a title="Microsoft" href="http://www.microsoft.com" rel="homepage" target="_blank">SILVERLIGHT</a></li><br /></ul><br />See the pattern here? Surely if this is a pain for me to work on with a Mac, imagine my frustrations when I'm using nothing but my smartphone and laptop dock on the road.  Usually I'm never that far from a PC with Windows on it; I have access to all the computers in the labs at the academy where I work, so usually I wait until then. But during the vacation periods when I'm away from campus, I end up bothering my friends for their PCs.  If Onlive has their way, then those days are over...  Ever heard of them?<br /><br /><a href="http://desktop.onlive.com/about" target="_blank">Onlive</a> is a company that stormed onto the scene about 2 years ago, showing off its idea for renting computer games in the same fashion that Netflix rents streaming movies.  Instead of waiting for a DVD-ROM to come in the mail, you use their software (which is a small "thin client") to connect to their server farms that house virtual instances of at least 300 games. Because their connection is so fast, and the computers they use are so powerful, you'll never see any lag... all the processing is on their side, and all you're doing is sending game control info to them from your keyboard or joystick and you just receive  a monitor and audio feed of the game.<br /><br />Remember, this is a <a title="Thin client" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thin_client" rel="wikipedia" target="_blank">THIN CLIENT</a>--it can be recompiled to run on ANYTHING... Still don't understand? OK, here's a video for ya...<br /><br />http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2u-gh8hQNAE<br /><br />When this came out, I was one of the first to sign up for it on my Mac-- I was an avid PC gamer actually and it's one of the things I gave up in the hopes that the technology would catch up... and boy did it catch up! I now use it on my smartphone and dock it to my 32" TV via <a title="HDMI" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HDMI" rel="wikipedia" target="_blank">HDMI</a>--We don't need no stinkin' Xboxes and PS3s 'round here!<br /><br />My next question after using this service was "it'd be cool if they gave us a <a title="Windows Virtual PC" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Virtual_PC" rel="wikipedia" target="_blank">Virtual PC</a> to access in this same manner..."  Looks like they've been listening to my thoughts...<br /><br />http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moswP0GVmM0&feature=related<br /><br />OMG! Let me get this straight.... they have a GIGABIT+ connection to the internet... and for US$10 a month I can:<br />* run WHATEVER software (My own PAID-FOR copies of Premiere, Photoshop, Illustrator, and AfterEffects I hope)<br />* View media heavy websites (and also get around that pesky IP thing since I'm in Japan and can't use my Netflix account over here for example)<br />*Be able to connect and use google docs, dropbox and pogoplug for storage<br /><br />Basically giving me the most powerful windows machine ever that I can access on ANYTHING for $120 a year?<br /><br />SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY!<br /><h6 style="font-size: 1em;">Related articles</h6><br /><ul><br />	<li style="overflow: hidden; list-style: none outside none; margin-top: 10px;"><img style="padding: 0pt; margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; border: 0pt none; display: block; float: left;" src="http://thumbs.zemanta.com/78127301.jpg" alt="" /><a style="display: block;" href="http://gigaom.com/mobile/onlive-brings-windows-desktops-in-cloud-to-android/">OnLive brings Windows desktops in cloud to Android</a><span style="display: block; font-size: 12px; margin: 10px 0pt;">(gigaom.com)</span><br /><div style="clear: both;"><br /><br /><hr style="margin: 0pt;" /><br /><br /></div></li><br />	<li><a href="http://gigaom.com/mobile/lookout-pc-even-the-kindle-fire-can-be-a-virtual-you/" target="_blank">Lookout PC: Even the Kindle Fire can be a virtual you</a> (gigaom.com)</li><br />	<li><a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-30977_3-57354993-10347072/onlive-to-stream-windows-desktop-to-ipad-android-devices/?part=rss&subj=AndroidAtlas" target="_blank">OnLive to stream Windows desktop to iPad, Android devices</a> (news.cnet.com)</li><br /></ul><br /><div style="margin-top: 10px; height: 15px;"><a title="Enhanced by Zemanta" href="http://www.zemanta.com/"><img class="zemanta-pixie-img" style="float: right;" src="http://img.zemanta.com/zemified_e.png?x-id=06184e5a-d98c-4cfb-810d-27f7e7e94d44" alt="Enhanced by Zemanta" /></a></div>
