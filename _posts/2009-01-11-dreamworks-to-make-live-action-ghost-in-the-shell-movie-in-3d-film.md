How come I'm just now hearing about this?!  MOTOKO!!!!!<br /><br />Of course being the Japan-a-holic that I am, I gotta watch this when it comes out.  Hell I gotta find a way to be in it!  I'm sure there will be a HUGE party in Akihabara when this comes out, and if I am still in Japan, I'm there dude.  The otaku in me will run to the nearest Shinkansen ticket machine and make sure of that.
