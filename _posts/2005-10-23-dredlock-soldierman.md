>I am asked why I have dredlocks on a constant basis.  Well in order to quell the questions, here is a short explanation:<br /><br /><span style="font-size:85%;">Never will I cut them... Even if I </span><u><span style="font-size:85%;">have </span></u><span style="font-size:85%;">to cut most off, I will save one. My dreds are the symbol of my liberated spirit. They serve to remind me why I am here and what I am supposed to do in life. </span><br /><span style="font-size:85%;">They are both my roots to keep me grounded, and my branches reaching into the sky to set me free and touch the hand of God.</span><br /><span style="font-size:85%;">They are bound sometimes into a ponytail to remind me of my slave ancestors who came across the vast ocean to a land and future unknown.</span><br /><span style="font-size:85%;">They hang loosely down my back to symbolize the freedom that all men crave, and eventually will be willing to fight to the death for, if not given.</span><br /><span style="font-size:85%;">They are lined up in neat rows and columns like orderly citizens in peacetime</span><br /><span style="font-size:85%;">Sometimes they are all over my head like the civil wars and conflagerations going on in the world.</span><br /><span style="font-size:85%;">My dredlocks are me.  I am my dredlocks.  This is more than just a simple hairstyle.  This is the symbol of my life.</span><br /><span style="font-size:85%;"></span><br />I hope the reason is much clearer now to you.  I’ve had my hair this way for 4 ½ years, and don’t see me cutting it anytime soon.  Not until my struggle is over.  Not until I get my life going the way I want it.
