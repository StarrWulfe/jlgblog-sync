All on the world's thinnest smartphone. </p><p>Remember-- iPhones are the ONLY phones available here in Japan that work 100% with networks in the US, UK, AUS, and most other places in the world. I got people telling me to get an Android phone--and I would if I were still in the States.  But all the features wouldn't work without me changing the ROM here in Japan...   </p><p>BTW, I had 4 iPad sightings in the wild over the last 5 days here in Nagoya.  Some dumb @$$ told me 3 weeks ago "Japanese would never buy that thing..."  Even more suprising is how this oblivious fool has lived in Japan for 12 years and can't even order a cheeseburger in Japanese here...  I'll say it again-- DUMB@$$!</p></div><p style="font-size: 9px;">  Posted via web from <a href="http://starrwulfe.info/apple-announces-iphone-4-steve-jobs-keynote-v">...all about starrwulfe...</a>  </p></div>
