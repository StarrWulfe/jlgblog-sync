><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Thru the emptiness in my heart, I keep the candle lit.<br />It burns bright for all to see... My hopes, my dreams, and even the failures and broken promises... These fuel the candle. <br /><br />This candle is there in my heart to guide my love to me. <br /><br />Ever vigilant, I also sit atop the tallest mountian in my soul. Armed with my binoculars and telescopes, and the latest radio-satelllite-infrared tracking gadgetry, I am looking for her candle as well. <br /><br />Even as it snows and rains in my heart, my candle will not go out, so long as there is the hope that I may one day be united with her. <br /><br />Maybe I need to install a spotlight, foghorn, and have a fireworks display and laser show going on too...</div>
