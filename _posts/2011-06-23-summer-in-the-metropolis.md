In honor of my first summer living in the 京浜葉玉 metropolis...  <br />http://youtu.be/tGBOGVS3P-8<br />Every year when the summer solstice hits, I'm amazed how the sun comes up promptly at 4am here in Japan (no daylight savings time here) and how it goes from being warm and tolerable, to HOT AS HELL and MUGGY in ONE DAY.  Japan in the summer...   But then again I also know that firework festivals, days at the beach, gyukushi stands (beef-on-a-stick) and my favorite--pretty girls in summer yukata.... All that's just around the corner.  Yes.  It makes me have... SUMMER MADNESS! So when you see a dude rockin' out with headphones on the Toyoko train line this summer... this is what I'm thinking, and this is what I'm listening to.
