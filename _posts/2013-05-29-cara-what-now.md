Ever the watchdog for things in Japan that just don't really make any sense, this time I rant about a booze commercial that's borderline racially ignorant...

The <a href="http://www.kirin.co.jp/about/toku/ad/brand/player2.html?bctid=492086140002&amp;autoStart=false" target="_blank">commercial I'm referencing is for Kirin Caraboon Wine Cooler</a>... Which now that I type this, sounds real close to "coon" at the end... Hmmm...

Do you agree with me, or am I being to sensitive here... Let me know in the comments below!
