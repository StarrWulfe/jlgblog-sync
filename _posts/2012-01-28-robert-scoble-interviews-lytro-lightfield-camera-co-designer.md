We can now capture a photon's direction of travel and mathematically predict what it'll look like if we were to re-focus our viewpoints on that object.<br />We've already pretty much kissed our point 'n shoot cameras goodbye the day we picked up smartphones that had 5+ megapixel cameras in them.<br />Now here's the ultimate expression of that paradigm, the lightfield camera, in the form of the Lytro.<br />Imagine NEVER focusing on anything in your viewfinder. Just take a shot, and every light ray and it's direction of travel is saved, so later you can focus on whatever point you like... or EVERY POINT can be in focus.<br />That's better than your own eyes.<br />One more point: Steve Jobs was talking to these guys about doing a project together before his untimely death. Hmmm.<br /><br /> <br /><br />
