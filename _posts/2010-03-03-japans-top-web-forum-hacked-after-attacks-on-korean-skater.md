I mean I'm used to seeing the loud-ass vans driving around large train stations during holidays, loudly and obnoxiously calling for an end to foreign visas and immigrations into Japan.  (when questioned, most of these people say, "oh you're AMERICAN...  We mean the OTHER gaijin that are here."  "The ones from Asia"  Wait...  I thought JAPAN was a part of ASIA too... Stupid me and my knowing geography...)   WTF?!</p></div><p style="font-size: 9px;">  Posted via web from <a href="http://starrwulfe.info/japans-top-web-forum-hacked-after-attacks-on">...all about starrwulfe...</a>  </p></div>
