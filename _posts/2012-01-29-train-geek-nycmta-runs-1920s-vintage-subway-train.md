Train Geek: NYCMTA runs 1920&#039;s vintage train on IRT 7 Av. Line for HBO Promo<br /><br />I&#039;d be smiling ear-to-ear if I was the motorman driving this train. I&#039;ve never seen the average New Yorker run to a subway train just to take a quick picture.<br />Also, they should bring those whistles back (you&#039;ll hear it as the train departs) That would be cool even on a new train.<br /><br />http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xYWnj7rWFs
