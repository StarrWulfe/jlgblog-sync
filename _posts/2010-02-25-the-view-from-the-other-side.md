I've been back in Japan for a year and a half now and I'm at the point where the newness has faded and day-to-day life has set in. This is my reality, and back home is like a fantasyland now. I'll be traveling back to the land of cheap pizzas, bigger houses, and women who wear pants--otherwise known as America, next month. I miss home. I miss pizza that costs less than $20 and has toppings that don't involve corn or mayonnaise.  I miss going to Barnes & Noble and reading all the car magazines, killing hours of time in the process. And of course I miss my friends and family. But I forget that there was a big reason why I came here to Japan in the first place. This is where I am meant to be right now.  Read earlier posts in this blog before I came here and you'll get it. I need to be here--it's an inescapable feeling I've always had, and in the end, only goes away when I'm here. But I can't see the forest for the trees right now... So sometimes it takes a wake-up call from friends to shake me back into reality.   <br /><br /><h5><span>1:05pm</span><a href="http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100000499181856">Rashad</a></h5><div>I think in your being in Japan for so long </div><div>you've forgotten what a wonder it is to outside eyes</div><div>and you trivalize stuff</div><div>there are things there that just don't happen here</div><div>and I think you need to focus more on Japan's uniqueness</div><div>like the Akirabura [Akihabara] section or however you say it</div><div>The fact that manga is read by young and old there</div><div>the cosplay</div><div>the cuisine all of these would be great topics</div><div>even the kickass electronics</div><h5><span>1:07pm</span>Jason</h5><div>True-- but that's true of anyplace that you make into your home man. once you're here everyday-- making a living, going about day-to-day socializing, that all changes..</div><div>back in '96 I was saying the same thing about ATL.
