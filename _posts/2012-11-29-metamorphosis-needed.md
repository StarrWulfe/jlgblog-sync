I guess that should be a testament to the dedication I have to my students!<br /><div style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><br />I recently decided that my old Wordpress install was trying to be too many things at once. Not to mention some Chinese hackers (I could tell by the bits of code they tried to insert) had a go at my server a few times and cause me some headaches--but no real pain. This is my personal site and it's mirrored in a few places so they can't stop me...no one can really.<br /><br /><br /><br />Anyway, I've narrowed my focus down to what I want to do with my new website:<br /><br /><br /><ul><li>Show off my talents in video and photography--along with my journalistic and creative writing prowess. </li><li>Help others living as ex-pats here in Japan</li><li>Help Japanese live in Japan too! (You'd be surprised...)</li><li>Give advice in the area of digital living and how to use technology to make life easier</li></ul><br />I've noticed that I tend to do a lot of the above on the internet now--but in different, disparate areas--for example, I give tech advice to friends on Google Plus, give advice to other expats on Facebook, show off my pictures from my travels on Instagram and within Facebook, show any video I take on YouTube and post links where ever I need...and I kind of use Twitter as a soapbox the the general public to broadcast my thoughts and links to my content.<br /><br />This is not an efficient means to showing a unified persona to the internet at large, nee the general public. My various usernames are all different across these sites--so people who know me as "J7" in real life (IRL) would also need know me as jason.gatewood on Facebook, jlgatewood on LinkedIn, and some form of "StarrWulfe" everywhere else. You'd also need to know that I do business as "Streetside Media" and there's a separate website for that as well... I may as well be suffering from Multiple Personality Disorder with all the different internet persona I have to maintain!<br /><br />Enough... I need to figure out a way to tie it all together. After conferencing with many of my other "technogeek" friends in the know, they say the best way is STILL to "roll your own" website. Only that way can I control all the content being shown and have it all linked to myself under one roof.  So last night, I sat down and made some "deliverables"--These are the goals of my new site, and what I want to accomplish with it.<br /><br /><ul><li>First and formost, keep a prominent area that introduces myself and my CV along with sample works. </li><li>Provide a central place to see content I generate on other SNS sites (G+, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, etc) by "pulling" content from those places and automatically keeping it on my site where it can never disappear.</li><li>Provide a central place to comment and discuss the content I generate or just talk about things in general.</li><li>Provide a large storehouse for my original content (mainly pictures and video at the moment, but maybe I'll also share some music that I've been working on and also some creative writings as well)</li><li>Provide SECURED areas for my CLIENTS to view works in progress, but keep the public OUT. </li><li>Be able to administer this new site from PCs, smartphones and tablets. </li></ul><br />I've got most of the setup outlined in my mind and on paper now-- so now it's time to pull the plug on the old site, and rebuild. When I'm done, I'm hoping I'll have something that will serve me until The Next Best Thing Happens. <br /><br />I anticipate the new site will come online in a basic form by next week. Until then, all my sites will redirect here, so you know what's going on.<br /><br />I'm still posting articles and microblogging though--check me out...<br /><br />G+ page:<br /><a href="http://profiles.google.com/JLGatewood">http://profiles.Google.com/JLGatewood</a><br /><br />Facebook:<br /><a href="http://facebook.com/Jason.Gatewood">http://Facebook.com/Jason.Gatewood</a><br /><br />Twitter:<br /><a href="http://twitter.com/starrwulfe">http://twitter.com/starrwulfe</a><br /><br />Lastly, if anyone has any advice about what I'm trying to do and can help in anyway--COMMENT BELOW!!<br /><br />Thanks and Blessings to all.<br /><br />JLG.j7<br /><br />
