It was a HUGE Treo 300.  8 years and 3 models later there have been lots of changes...  My current Treo 700 doesn't run Palm OS, it runs Windows Mobile 6 (well it came with 5.0, but I hacked the firmware a few months ago to run 6)  Its a little bit smaller, a whole lot faster, and does more than even the PC I had in 2000.<br /><br />When I bought that first smartphone, only techno-nerds like me would be caught dead with one...  Now if you don't have something that can jump on You-Tube, browse eBay, take pictures and videos, and play MP3s...  Oh and take phone calls too, you're officially out of the "electronicly trendy in-club".   How do you like that, I've actually gotten in on the beginning of something trendy and cool...  Unlike that time I tried to start a new trend by cutting my hair into a "Hi-top-triangle" back in 1988...  Yeah those were the days.<br /><br />So I guess this will be the next chapter in my treo book.  </span><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-size:100%;"><br /></span></span></span></span>
