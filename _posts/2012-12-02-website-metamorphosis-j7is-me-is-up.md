<div style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://canadiansinternet.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/URL_Link_Shortener.jpg" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://canadiansinternet.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/URL_Link_Shortener.jpg" width="298" /></a></div>Step one of my "Grand Unifying" website overhaul is complete. <br /><br />I've noticed that the majority of my time on the internet isn't spent so much on writing new content so much as re-sharing content I've either written or others have made. With Twitter and Facebook along with Google Plus now occupying so much of the internet "cybersphere", no one is really taking the time to hunt down blogs and other disparate websites anymore-- Content that is discovered is usually found via SNS (Social Network Sites). <br /><br />This is all fine but I want people to check my content out on my site somehow--or at least make them remember my brand. One way to do that is by making a private link shortening service.<br /><br />Of course you've heard of Bit.ly, TinyURL, is.gd and the others that take a long URL and shrink it down to just a few characters. Twitter kind of invented this niche because of the 140 character limit; nobody wants half their tweet taken up with a URL. Now Twitter shortens every link using a "t.co/xxx" schema, so it's a bit moot...But I still like being able to give out easy to remember links to content using link shorteners. Plus it makes it easy to type URLs into smartphones.<br /><br />So I decided to make my own. First I needed a short domain name... Well my nickname is "J7"... but all domains need to be at least 3 letters. hmm... I know-- If I use the TLD ".me" I can make "J7is.me"! And that's what I've done.  From now on, I'm using my own link shortener for everything! Go and try it! <br /><br />This page for example is <a href="http://j7is.me/3">http://J7is.ME/3</a><br /><br />I can make custom links for myself as well... Check out my profiles:<br /><ul><li><a href="http://j7is.me/google" target="_blank">http://J7is.ME/google</a>    </li><li><a href="http://j7is.me/facebook" target="_blank">http://J7is.ME/facebook</a>    </li><li><a href="http://j7is.me/twitter" target="_blank">http://J7is.ME/twitter</a> </li><li><a href="http://j7is.me/linkedin" target="_blank">http://J7is.ME/linkedin</a></li></ul><br />Of course you can always reach this site by just remembering <a href="http://j7is.me/1" target="_blank">http://J7is.ME/1</a><br /><br />Stay tuned--the metamorphosis continues...And if you have some ideas or wanna share advice and questions, comment please!<br />
