大阪環状線の運転手はもすぐシバクセイヘんやろな！

This dude is about to get his @$$ chin-checked by the train motorman...  Wonder what he was goin' on about anyway.  I love <a class="zem_slink" title="Osaka" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=34.6938888889,135.502222222&amp;spn=0.1,0.1&amp;q=34.6938888889,135.502222222 (Osaka)&amp;t=h" rel="geolocation" target="_blank">Osaka</a> for that. Only place in Japan were folks have some "fire" in their spirit--publicly that is...  Most Japanese are known for being more calm and reserved in public, and just "take it"...
