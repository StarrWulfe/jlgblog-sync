<br />Fellow netizens it&#39;s time to gear up once again and fight the US government along with Big Business who want to turn the internet into the biggest spying, prying, regulated communications network on earth. Don&#39;t believe that mumbo-jumbo anti-terrorism counter-intelligence <i>bullshit</i> for a second... Or need I remind you about the PATRIOT ACT? (Yeah, I feel so safe now after having stripped down to my drawls at the airport) <br />Folks this is designed to kill the truest form of American idealistic democracy there is... The FREE Internet-- Free as in LIBERTY.<br /><br />The best thing about the net is you can say whatever you want and no one even needs to know its you. You can interact with people around the world and are free to wander in and out of sites at will, whether its a church group site about bible classes, or am S&M site devoted to leather masks with zippers. Whatever your pleasure, you can seek it without repercussions here. The Guhhmint wants to take that away by making it so the companies that provide your internet service can show and sell your net history WITHOUT YOUR CONSENT. REALLY?!?<br /> <br /> <a href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23CISPA">#CISPA</a>   <a href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23internetfreedom">#internetfreedom</a>  <a href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23JLGj7">#JLGj7</a><p style='clear:both;'><iframe type='text/html' width='97.5%' height='385' src='http://www.youtube.com/v/Ya2TmSmbUQI?hl=en&fs=1' frameborder='0'></iframe></p><p style='clear:both;'> <strong>Google+:</strong> <a href="https://plus.google.com/108098330393589915102/posts/96wZtbacMW1" target="_new">View post on Google+</a></p><br /><br /><i>Post imported by Google+Blog.
