Yes there's crime in Japan...  Not as much as it is back home, for sure-- But I think EVERYONE knows about Japan's mob. The infamous Yakuza network of crime syndicates. They've been around for literally hundreds of years and are a direct offshoot of the samurai/shogunate system that ended in 1868 with the Meiji restoration.  As we know, crime does pay, if you become very good at it, and of course--don't get caught.  But they're starting to really crack down on organized crime here-- particularly here in central Japan where I happen to live.
