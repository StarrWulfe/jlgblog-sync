I mean DAMN. It's 2011 god-dammit.  So why the HELL is this kinda $#¡† on TV here?!  This is what happens when you have a population that lives in a WALLED GARDEN...<br /><a name='more'></a><br />From <a href="http://www.japanprobe.com/2011/02/02/tiger-woods-blackface-act-on-japanese-tv" target="_blank">JapanProbe</a>:<br />[box color=blue]<br /><br />On Monday night’s episode of “Sekai Maru Mie TV,” somebody thought it would be hilarious to put black paint on the face of a Japanese guy so he could apparently look like Tiger Woods:<br /><img src="http://www.jlgatewood.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/blackface-tiger-woods-in-japan.jpg" alt="" /><br />http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xgublf_tiger-woods-black-face-probe_webcam<br />[/box]<br /><br />I mean WTF. Why the hell do these folks think they gotta put on BLACKFACE to portray someone of color?  I don't see them putting on 50 coats of WHITE foundation to pretend to be DAVID BECKAM, BRAD PIT, TOM CRUISE, or anyone else WHITE.<br /><br />This ain't comedy, it's RACIST!!<br /><br />And I know if I did something like this--<br /><br /><img src="http://www.jlgatewood.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/mryunioshi.jpg" alt="racist japanese image" /><br /><br />I'd get FIRED from my job, OUSTED from my neighborhood, and all but DEPORTED from here...<br /><br />Here's some more instances of this ol' BULL$#¡†:<br />http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djZIpmp_nVo<br />http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpNSip5gyKo
