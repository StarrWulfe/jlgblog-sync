Our clubs are legendary. The nightlife in this town is talked about in every r&b and hip hop song you've gotten low to.  And remember freaknic?  The 29 mile long hedonistic exhibiton thats one part Mardi Gras and one <br />part Lil John music video.  They decided to bring that back...  Unfortunately I'll be back in Japan when it goes down next week though. <br /><br />But I'm here tonight...  So what's poppin'?<br />
