This is nice. Think they can make a chromed Eva-00 with a Rei Ayanami to go with it? *Hopes for the best*<br /><br /><a name='more'></a><br /><div><br /><blockquote><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-126260" title="yamato" src="http://www.jlgatewood.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/yamato-620x414.jpg" alt="yamato" width="620" height="414" /><br /><br />Space Battleship Yamato is the name of a (rather short-lived) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Battleship_Yamato">Japanese science fiction anime series</a> that was aired on TV in countries other than Nippon some 20 to 30 years ago (outside Japan the anime and the movie versions are also known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Blazers_%28TV_Series%29">Star Blazers</a> or Space Cruiser Yamato). And now, the series’ very cool, eponymous spaceship gets a very pretty <a href="http://p-bandai.jp/hobby/item-1000004135/">model version</a> [JP].<br /><br /><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-126261" title="yamato2" src="http://www.jlgatewood.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/yamato2.jpg" alt="yamato2" width="500" height="335" /><br /><br />The 1/350 Battleship Yamato scale model is made by Bandai, coated with silver color and looks just awesome. Users get a remote control with which they can make the ship “shoot” or activate the rear engine (you hear cannon shots and see blinking LEDs). The model itself is sized at 766×220×102mm and weighs 1,950g (including the stand). Bandai throws in a bunch of figures (the heroes of the anime) and a set of mini fighter jets, too.<br /><br /><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-126262" title="yamato3" src="http://www.jlgatewood.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/yamato3.jpg" alt="yamato3" width="500" height="335" /><br /><br />In Japan, Bandai is already accepting pre-orders and will start shipping the first Battleship models to buyers starting from the end of December. The beauty isn’t cheap though: $850. If you’re interested but live outside Japan, ask the <a href="http://www.japantrendshop.com/">Japan Trend Shop</a> or <a href="http://www.geekstuff4u.com/">Geek Stuff 4 U</a> if they can buy one for you.</blockquote><br /><div>via <a href="http://www.crunchgear.com/2009/11/24/japan-gets-awesome-space-battleship-yamato-model/#comment-1147466">crunchgear.com</a></div><br /></div>
