No matter how well I speak Japanese here, it seems half the service industry won't understand a thing I say unless I *look* like them. Sometimes it seems as if they're watching a TV show when I'm trying to speak to the guy behind the service counter at miscellaneous shop or government installation.

Right now I'm trying to change the phone number associated with my Lawson point card (Lawson is a chain of convenience stores here, like 7-11). My phone number hasn't changed in 5 years, and I'm guessing this card is either older, or some goofball transposed the digits when they did the data entry on it.

<em>(Japanese people are sometimes ANAL about the way ARABIC numerals are written. I'll have to post a rant about that crap someday)</em>

[caption id="attachment_1635" align="alignleft" width="300"]<img class=" wp-image-1635  " style="margin: 3px;" title="J7 gives the &quot;Gas Face&quot;" src="http://jlgatewood.com.previewdns.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/PIC000206.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" /> This is the face I make when shit doesn't make sense....or the flash is too bright. Or both.[/caption]

So I go to Lawson and ask the store staff if they could change the info, or if I need to call someone...And the guy just stands there transfixed on me like I'm an anomaly in the space/time continuum. I then made myself speak "textbook" Japanese thinking this guy might not understand my slightly western Japan accent I picked up whenever I speak casually (I'll have to talk about THAT sometime too. Apparently it's EXTREMELY RARE for a foreign guy to have an accent in Japanese that's anything other than what White Folks On NHK (tm) have over here. That is to say, I sound "too native" at times for some--if that's even possible.

After he finally "gets it" he then tells me I need to call the Customer Hotline on the back of the card. Right. Got it.
I then call said number and wind up talking to some chick named Uchida. Ms. Uchida gets my standard phone introduction I give whenever dealing with anyone over the phone in Japan: "I'm from a different country, so please do not use "Keigo" as much as possible, and also try to speak slowly so I can follow completely."

Keigo is a level of Japanese that is EXTREMELY polite and distancing. &lt;commentary&gt;Japanese people use it to separate themselves from the transactions they are performing so when they fuck it up, it ain't really their fault--shit happens &lt;/commentary&gt; Ms. Uchida flat out didn't hear any of what I said and proceeds to ask me very Keigo-like "What can I help you with?"
<blockquote>My point card has erroneous information attached to it, and I'd like to fix it so I can use the online service.
OK. What's the number and password?
That's the problem. There's no password.
There's always a password, sir.
OK, well I don't remember assigning one. Is there some other way to get it processed?
Can you give me the phone number assigned to it?
No ma'am. If I could remember that part, I could fix it on the website. That's why I need to handle this with a human.
(long pause) Can you give me the email address assigned to it?
I'll give you my mobile phone address, phone number, and email address. Also my name is ____. My birth date is __/__/__ (May as well make her write all the info NOW.)
Thank you, please hold....
(2 minutes later)
I'm going to transfer you to XX department. They can help you better. I'm sorry for the wait.
(WTF?!)
Hello, this is Mr Shiozaki. may I have your point card number, phone number and password please?
Umm... Never mind. I'll call back later. Thanks.</blockquote>
I've seen Japanese people get on the phone and get this stuff taken care of in 5 minutes max. There's something I'm missing in my vocabulary or some form of telepathy that I need in order to get customer service no kami to warm up to me.

Here's the thing though-- my friends with Japanese wives and girlfriends don't go through this hell... They do it for them. When I ask them, "Don't you hate getting on the phone with customer service or dealing with the guy at the counter", I get a bewildered look. "Dude WTF are you saying? Get your girlfriend to call them and don't worry about it!" ...I see... I've been going about this all wrong it seems. wakatta.

So for that reason, I am putting this on my list of why I <del>want</del> need a Japanese girlfriend.
