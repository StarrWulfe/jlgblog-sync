This time Benrose, my partner in crime, wrote a challenge for your favorite camera-jockey... a 14 minute long tracking shot. How to work this? Thank God for Home Depot! We built a dolly and threw some furniture in our empty-ass storefront we pass off as a set... At equal parts of talent, crew, and equipment and you get the first StreetSide Media production shot in our own facilities!! Now that's hot...<br />A 14 minute short comedy parodying reality TV shows. No cuts, no edits... Just action! </p><p>We've entered it into a new reality TV competition called <em>The Lot</em>.<br />On the Lot is the new Fox reality filmmaking show, where filmmaker contestants produce short films to compete for a $1 Million development deal. <a href="http://films.thelot.com/films/17034">Please vote for StreetSide's own Ben Rose</a>-- a vote for him, means a vote for me too-- He's the MC and I'm the DJ. Without both of us, StreetSide doesn't exist!</p><p><a href="http://films.thelot.com/films/17034" target="_blank"><strong><span style="color:#660000;">http://films.thelot.com/films<wbr>/17034</wbr></span></strong></a></p>
