I pray to god someone at Avex/Sony in Tokyo has already signed her to at least do the next Bleach movie theme or something...  or be on a track with Koda Kumi, Amuro Namie, and Soulhead...  She can even sing with Misia...  <br /><br />If you look closely, she even has that "sista-girl" neck thing too!!  Man this chick can sing!!<br /><br />Check out her official MySpace page:  <a href="http://www.myspace.com/charicepempengco" title="Linkification: http://www.myspace.com/charicepempengco">http://www.myspace.com/charicepempengco</a>
