So after work last Friday, I was minding my own business sitting outside of the huge shopping complex in my part of Taipei, drinking a <a class="zem_slink" title="Chūhai" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ch%C5%ABhai" target="_blank" rel="wikipedia">Chu-Hi</a> (yeah, I still do that). Along come these 2 guys shooting a video using a selfie-stick and holding a yellow flower.

One of them asks. "Can I kiss you?" I sat in silence for 5 seconds thinking, "where are the hidden cameras...I thought the 'LGBT PrideFest was only ONCE a year...Maybe this is a pre-Chinese New Year thing I haven't heard about yet...Am I gonna get some $$$ for this?!"

They then explained it was for a Valentine's day <a class="zem_slink" title="Viral video" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_video" target="_blank" rel="wikipedia">viral video</a> they were making... I kinda know what it's like making random viral videos... <a href="http://youtu.be/PP1uhGN8GWE?t=3m47s" target="_blank">So I just pecked him on the cheek, and the other guy pecked me back.</a> Whatevs, it works for the French, and I'm pretty safe with my manhood...

Anyhoo, turns out those guys are trying to start their own production company here in <a class="zem_slink" title="Taiwan" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=25.0333333333,121.633333333&amp;spn=10.0,10.0&amp;q=25.0333333333,121.633333333 (Taiwan)&amp;t=h" target="_blank" rel="geolocation">Taiwan</a> and this is a part of it. They spent the <a class="zem_slink" title="Valentine's Day" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valentine%27s_Day" target="_blank" rel="wikipedia">Valentine's Day</a> weekend just wandering around Taipei randomly kissing folks...old people, babies, men, women...dogs... and wishing them a Happy Valentine's.

Because all everyone needs is a little love.

You know...next year, I think I'll rally some troops and see if we can't do this in Tokyo. Would be interesting to see the difference between Taiwanese and Japanese randomness.
