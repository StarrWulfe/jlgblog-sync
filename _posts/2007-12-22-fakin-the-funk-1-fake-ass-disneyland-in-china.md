<img src="http://www.jlgatewood.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/7-dwarves.jpg" align="left" />I'm starting a new column here in the blog called "Fakin' the Funk".  Whenever I run across something that's a bad representation of the original, be it tangible or intangible, It'll go here.<br /><br />We're gonna start this show off right--  Here's a fake-ass Disneyland in China, which has long been the "knock-off" capital of the world anyway.<br /><br /><p>From <em>The Standard</em> we learn that Beijing's state-owned <a href="http://www.bs-amusement-park.com/">Shijingshan Amusement Park</a> boasts the slogan "Disneyland is too far" and "features a replica of Cinderella's Castle, with staff dressed like Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs and other Disney characters." Here's a quote from a 31-year-old housewife and mother at the park that nicely sums up the situation:</p>  <blockquote>"I don't understand why that is such a big problem. Shouldn't others be able to use those characters besides [Disney]?" she asks.</blockquote>  <p><a href="http://www.japanprobe.com/">Japan Probe</a> offers us this gem:</p>  <blockquote>Some have claimed that the park is illegally copying Disney’s Minnie Mouse. However, the park’s operators have insisted that the character ... is not a mouse. It is a cat with very large ears!</blockquote>  <a href="http://www.japanprobe.com/">Japan Probe</a> also links to several video clips of Japaneses news broadcasts on the  topic.<br /><br /><p><em>All images originally appeared on <a href="http://www.japanprobe.com/">Japan Probe</a>.</em></p>  <p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Japan Probe finds <a href="http://www.japanprobe.com/?p=1724">fake zebras</a> at the fake Disneyland, and more Chinese amusement parks <a href="http://www.japanprobe.com/?p=1740">ripping off just about everybody</a>. And the <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/news/news.html?in_article_id=454160&in_page_id=1770">AP reports that</a> Shijingshan might be trying to clean up its act.</p><p>We'll see.  If they can <a href="http://www.jlgatewood.com/www.engadget.com/2007/01/29/meizus-m8-apple-lawyers-start-your-engines/">fake the Apple iPhone</a> and get away with it, then why not everything else...<br /></p><br /><br /><object height="373" width="425"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/0-JULFxB0sk&rel=1&border=1"></param><param name="wmode" value="transparent"><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/0-JULFxB0sk&rel=1&border=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" height="373" width="425"></embed></param></object><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-JULFxB0sk"><br />Mobile Video Link<br /></a>
