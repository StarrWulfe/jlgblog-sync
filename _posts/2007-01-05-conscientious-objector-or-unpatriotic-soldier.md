Ehren Watada, a 28-year-old Hawaii native, is the first commissioned officer in the U.S. to publicly refuse deployment to <a title="Related information on Iraq" href="http://search.news.yahoo.com/search/news/?p=Iraq">Iraq</a>. He announced last June his decision not to deploy on the grounds the war is illegal. I believe he is simply practicing his constitutionally approved and protected right to protest. Our military is currently an all volunteer one. Although you're sworn to protect and serve the country, Why should it supercede the constitutional laws granted in this country? Ehren is simply utilizing the values he was sworn to protect. You don't get any more American and patriotic than that. Besides, would you do something against your values if you were in the same position? Let's say you're given the job to protect a person... You have to do whatever this person demands no matter what. That person orders you to walk into a lion's den blindfolded with raw steaks taped your naked body for his/her entertainment. Do you do it? Well?? </p></div>
