My mother signed her name and a patch of earth is now soverign territory for our family.  All my life my mom has wanted a house.  Not a mansion or acres of land, just a place to call home that no one else can claim.  Today she claimed her dream.    I only felt bad for Â½ a second because I always thought I'd be the one to buy her one.  What son wouldn't want to buy his mom a house?  But her dream is my dream too.  If she can see a multi-year plan into fruition, then so can I.  I will fufill my dreams, because I have the greatest proof that dreams can come true now.  Today my mom bought a home, and a promise.
