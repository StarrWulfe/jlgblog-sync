As usual, I was riding the train home from work in a borderline coma this afternoon. My hour-long commute takes me from the suburban melancholiness that is Saitama, then abruptly bores through Tokyo's most prominent areas like Shinjuku and Shibuya, while speeding me back to my home in the hills of Yokohama. While making the stop in Shinjuku, I overheard the tones of loud, slang-filled English, and banshee-like laughter that can only be associated with foreign exchange students from America here in Tokyo.
I lazily cocked my head in their direction to catch more of their conversation, and realized 4 seconds in I didn't wanna talk to them. "Oh, y'all talkin' 'bout THAT sh**... Y'all young and fresh off the plane", was the actual thought going through my mind. (My mind's voice sounds a bit like <a class="zem_slink" title="Charlie Murphy" href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0614151/" rel="imdb" target="_blank">Charlie Murphy</a>.)
The two Japan neophytes were going on about how many girls they were hooking up with. But I could tell they were actually just suffering from "Zero to Hero" complex. This is where you take an average to sub-average Westerner and deposit him/her into possibly the most ethnically homogenous societies on the planet, Japan.

Wait.  Let me let someone else more eloquent than I tell you about it.  A good friend of mine, <a href="https://plus.google.com/110784724505507797993" target="_blank">Dwayne Lively</a>, already talked about this on his blog way back in 2003. As you will see, nothing has changed in 10 years.

&nbsp;
<blockquote>"All men become monsters in Asia" was uttered by an English teacher who worked in Japan several years ago. She was recounting a much anticipated reunion between her and an old friend who had been working in Another Asian Country at the same time. The pompous, patronising, know-it-all attitude she encountered from her friend reminded her of many of her male colleagues in Japan, prompting the pithy epigraph. (Said, it should be noted, with a knowing look, as your humble editor was getting ready to depart for Japan.)

It's easy to dismiss the comment and the assessment of the encounter with the argument that there are two sides to every story and maybe she was just having a bad day. However, there is a general tendency for men to become monsters in Asia. It's a male dominated world with subservient women where foreign skin in general, and white skin in particular, carry a certain mystique.

It's a cliche to describe Japan as "The Land Where Ugly Men Rule" but there is a substantial nugget of truth to it. A man who is considered "plain" or "average" in his home country (your humble editor, it should be noted, is just plain average) suddenly finds, often much to his surprise, that he has attracted droves of adoring Japanese female fans. If nothing else, if he's teaching in a school, there are droves of mini-skirted teenage girls calling him "handsome" and lining up to have their picture taken with him. Japanese men seem intimidated by him, especially if the foreign man is tall, and it's rather easy for him to impose his will on others.

Much of this, however, is mere appearance bordering on bovine scatology. Although a great many Japanese women may find foreign men attractive and may be interested in adding a foreign notch or two to their lipstick cases, the truth is that a great many more will remain in a boring conversation long beyond the point when a western woman would have feigned death to make the man go away. The droves of mini-skirted high school girls are no more interested in him then they would be in a pet rabbit or pet dog roaming around the school. The men may be intimidated and may seem to be playing along, but they are probably just humoring the foreign man to calm him down and make him go away.

It's very easy for a foreign man to let all the attention and subservience go to his head and therefore it's very easy for him to become a monster. A few months in Japan, often before the first wave of culture shock has set in, also produces a number of Instant Asia Experts who are fond of pointing out the deficiencies in the knowledge of those burdened with several years of life in Asia under their belt. (Your humble editor once had a person two weeks off the plane give him a lecture about the nature of "the typical Japanese".)

Although foreign men can exploit the foreign mystique to a certain point, a man who looks around and actually sees what's going on around him, may see a completely different Japan. He may also find that "the typical Japanese" may be far less fond of him than he wants to believe.

...My only addition to the above statements: If this is you, stop it. You're not a mack. When you go back home, nothing will have changed. If you stay here in Japan long enough, that novelty wears off.

If you are in Japan now, have you experienced this? Are you <em>this</em>? Sound off in the comments!
