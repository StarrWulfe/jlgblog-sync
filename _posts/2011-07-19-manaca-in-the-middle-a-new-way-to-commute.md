<strong><a class="zem_slink" title="Manaca" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manaca" rel="wikipedia" target="_blank">Manaca</a> in the Middle:</strong>
<strong> A new way to commute</strong>
<em>Originally appeared in <a>RANmagazine, Issue 10 March / April 2011</a></em>

<img class="alignleft" src="http://jlgatewood.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/fOSRp.jpg" alt="" width="408" height="441" />No doubt by now you've seen and perhaps even used Manaca, Nagoya's new fare card in use on the city‚Äôs subways and buses along with <a class="zem_slink" title="Meitetsu" href="http://www.meitetsu.co.jp/" rel="homepage" target="_blank">Meitetsu</a> buses and trains. Manaca was introduced on February 11th to replace the Yurika and Transpass fare cards, and serves the same basic purpose as a stored value farecard making it easy to speed through the turnstiles at the station. <a name="more"></a>Because Manaca is an IC or integrated circuit based card, there is no need to insert the card into the wicket or fare box. Just tap the blue rectangle and go. If that were not enough, this card works two ways like your cash card, opening many other doors as well. counts to frequent riders of the system. Depending on how much you use the system per month, you can receive up to a 15% discount in fares in the next month. This is to replace the Yurika system whereby buying more fare added extra trips on the top (i.e. the ¥2000 card actually had ¥2200 in fares, ¥5000 had ¥5600 and so on).
The other aspect of Manaca is its use as an e-money card. JR East in Tokyo pioneered this several years ago, when they decided to place card readers on all the vending machines located in their stations. This makes it easy for patrons to buy a drink without searching their pockets for change. Manaca continues this concept and takes it further with the inclusion of points. When you purchase items using your Manaca card, you will collect points that are then good for discounts on your transit fares. So go ahead and get that bento from Circle K, or Pon De Ringu from Mr. Donut - they take Manaca now too, and more are added all the time. For now, all Circle K stores in Aichi prefecture along with all in-station stores and restaurants and some located just outside the station entrances are accepting the card; just look for the manaca logo somewhere on the door of the business. Perhaps most importantly, Manaca is safe - if lost, it can be re-issued with the monies and passes still intact - but you MUST REGISTER IT FIRST. If you don't have your name printed on your card, it hasn't been registered. You can register your manaca at any ticket machine or station office. This way if your card comes up missing, you can have the value transferred to a new card. One other thing you may have noticed - Unlike many places in Japan, the new TVMs (ticket vending machines) have a proper English menu. All information is presented in its entirety in both languages. Also of note, it is now possible to get a receipt and a list of the last 20 fares printed out from the TVMs as well - great if you need to turn something in to be reimbursed on travel expenses. In the future, It will be possible to use Manaca on JR lines and other trains and buses in Japan as well as all the e-money functions. Remember to look out for promotional tie-ins with Manaca that will earn you points so you can save on train fare too!

Of course the world of the IC cards here in Nagoya is not entirely new, as JR Central introduced the Toica card about two years ago for use on their lines. However, many more people take the subway, bus, and meitetsu networks than anything else in Aichi and Gifu prefectures, thus opening up more potential. If you've been to Tokyo or Osaka and used a Suica, <a class="zem_slink" title="Pasmo" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasmo" rel="wikipedia" target="_blank">Passmo</a>, ICOCA, or Pitapa card, then you‚Äôll understand the concept. The Manaca card can be used as a pay-as-you-go card, a commuter pass, and electronic money. As a commuter pass, Manaca shines. Under the old system, commuters regularly had to visit a station that had a pass office like Fushimi or Sakae in order to purchase monthly passes. Now any ticket machine can apply and update the commuter pass to the Manaca cards. A side benefit to manaca commuter passes is the ability to store money on the card as well. This way you can travel outside your route and just tap the exiting station like normal, and the card will calculate the fare and discounts accordingly. The other benefit is that now it‚Äôs possible to have one commuter pass that covers your trip on both the city subway and Meitetsu trains. Also because it's a smart card, Manaca can offer the better discount automatically for certain point-to-point routes. A good example of this would be Inuyama to Sakae station. It has always been cheaper to take the Meitetsu line to Nagoya station and use the Higashiyama line, however even if you take the Komaki line and change to the Meijo line, you will now pay the same price - as long as you use a Manaca card. Also Manaca will soon start using points and mileage to issue dis-
