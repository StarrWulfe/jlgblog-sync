[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="500" caption="The Asus Padfone (Photo credit: blogeee.net)"]<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/13815526@N02/6934874429" target="_blank"><img class="zemanta-img-inserted zemanta-img-configured" title="Asus Padfone MWC 2012" src="http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7183/6934874429_cf6983da3c_m.jpg" alt="Asus Padfone MWC 2012" width="500" height="317" /></a>[/caption]<br /><br />There's a little gathering that happens every year in Barcelona, Spain every year called <a title="Mobile World Congress" href="http://www.mobileworldcongress.com/" rel="homepage" target="_blank">Mobile World Congress</a>, and it's the where the wireless industry gets together and shows off all the new tech that will drop in the next year. (of course Apple does their own thing, but there's more to smartphones than "iSomething" right?)<br /><br />At the last gathering back in 2011, there was something that caught my eye because of how similar it is to the <a title="Motorola Atrix 4G" href="http://www.motorola.com/Consumers/US-EN/Consumer-Product-and-Services/Mobile-Phones/Motorola-ATRIX-US-EN" rel="homepage" target="_blank">Motorola Atrix</a> that I since bought and have been using for about a year now.  Asus came up with the concept of docking a smartphone into a tablet.<br /><div><dl style="width: 310px;"><dt><a href="http://commons.wikipedia.org/wiki/File%3AMotorola_Atrix_4G_Webtop.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="zemanta-img-inserted zemanta-img-configured " style="lightbox" title="English: Picture from the Motorola Atrix 4G We..." src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9f/Motorola_Atrix_4G_Webtop.jpg/300px-Motorola_Atrix_4G_Webtop.jpg" alt="English: Picture from the Motorola Atrix 4G We..." width="300" height="200" /></a></dt></dl></div><br />In my Atrix, I can dock the phone into a latop-dock and the phone instantly boots over into a dumbed down version of Linux that shares its kernel with the Android system on the phone. The dock has no parts other than a bigger battery, a USB hub, 11" LCD screen and a power jack. The CPU <em>is the phone itself!</em> Then you can use the desktop version of Firefox from there-- kind of like Chrome OS and Android had a love-child.<br /><br />Asus showed just their concept of just having the screen get blown up 10" to go into a tablet of sorts and was scheduled to drop in May 2011. But there were some interesting developments that made them wait til now: <a title="Android Ice Cream Sandwich Walk-though - Nexus S" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3Pb6IyFvfg" rel="youtube" target="_blank">Ice Cream Sandwich</a>, and their own Transformer Pad series.<br /><br />With Ice Cream Sandwich, or Android 4.0, the code from phone-only Gingerbread (2.3) and tablet-only Honeycomb (3.0) were merged to create a one-for-all code base. Simply put, now Asus wouldn't have to make a proprietary program to internally shift from Gingerbread to Honeycomb whenever you docked the phone into the tablet, and also maintain it and 2 separate versions of Android-- because in Ice Cream Sandwich you can go from phone UI to tablet UI with just 3 lines of code to change the viewport size and there's NO REBOOTING NECESSARY-- it's 100% native code. Thanx Google! I can't tell you how big a deal this is-- I am working on an ICS custom ROM for the Atrix that will let me do the same thing when I dock it into the lapdock.<br /><div><dl style="width: 250px;"><dt><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/24224313@N06/5781012074" target="_blank"><img class="zemanta-img-inserted zemanta-img-configured " style="lightbox" title="Asus Padfone Nerdgasm" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2515/5781012074_d160de4b0f_m.jpg" alt="Asus Padfone Nerdgasm" width="240" height="135" /></a></dt></dl></div><br />The other thing was the success of the Transformer Pad line. Asus came up with the idea that a tablet should be able to dock into a keyboard to become a netbook-- also adding with it USB ports, a full-sized SD slot and a 3000mA BATTERY for extra juice. To date, the Transformer Prime is the most successful high end Android tablet. It kicks major butt and you can catch videos of it being used as a videogame console, photo editing station, and office workstation.  I was actually considering getting one of these myself, until I saw the updated design for the Padfone at the 2012 CES show in Las Vegas.  They announced that the phone that docks into the tablet, will also shape-shift once more and have the tablet dock into the keyboard a la the Transformer Pads. And yes, that also means MORE BATTERIES.<br /><br />They also seemed to have solved that one niggle I have with my Atrix--what happens when you're in tablet/netbook mode, a call comes in and you need to answer it? Right now with my Atrix, I try to make sure to have my bluetooth headset handy...but usually I forget it. You can also go into speakerphone mode by default, but usually I hurriedly detach the phone from the dock and talk then re-dock. A real pain in the @$$ if I'm in the middle of writing or reading something. Asus thought of everything and came up with a stylus that doubles as a HANDSET... Yeah, I made that same face too before I saw it, but it's a novel idea and looks like it'll work. Besides, it seems the stylus is making a comeback this year, so why not give it a go? Take notes, then take calls. I love it.<br /><br />Pix or it didn't happen, right?

No way in hades I'm lugging that thing on a 200% capacity train and risk it getting banged up or dropped.  For the work I do at the academy, it's more than sufficient; I use mostly Google Docs to do most things even at home, and you'd be surprised at how far along the apps have come for getting normal stuff done on Android.  I'll detail how I work with it as opposed to a traditional laptop in another blog posting later this week.  Also of note, you'll only need to pay ONE WIRELESS BILL! I know several people with tablets now that also have  a separate data plan for 3G access or just have a wi-fi version and are forced to look into hotspot access.  Since the phone is the brains of the tablet/netbook, there's no need for a separate anything bill-wise. Something I already enjoy in my current setup.  However there's one more thing  that would make Asus' new toy that much better...  <a title="Dear Ubuntu for Android Developers…" href="http://www.jlgatewood.com/2012/02/22/dear-ubuntu-for-android-developers/">Ubuntu came up with this last week</a>:<br /><br /><iframe src="//www.viddler.com/embed/644c9ce0/?f=1&autoplay=0&player=simple&secret=104903938&loop=false&nologo=false&hd=false" frameborder="0" width="437" height="266"></iframe><br /><br />Now having THAT on the Padfone would be SCHWEEEEEET!<br /><br />There's also something else that could sway my judgement as well...<br /><br /><a style="display: block;" href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/02/20/motorola-atrix-3-leak-promises-a-quad-core-chip-720p-screen-and-a-huge-battery/"><img style="padding: 0pt; margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; border: 0pt none; display: block; float: left;" src="http://thumbs.zemanta.com/76897955.jpg" alt="" />Motorola Atrix 3 Leak Promises A Quad-Core Chip, 720p Screen, And A Huge Battery</a><span style="display: block; font-size: 12px; margin: 10px 0pt;">(techcrunch.com)</span><br /><br /> <br /><br /> <br /><br />Uh-oh.... 2012 is gonna be a very hard year to decide who's gonna take my money!<br /><h6 style="font-size: 1em;">Related articles</h6><br /><ul><br />	<li style="overflow: hidden; list-style: none outside none; margin-top: 10px;"><img style="padding: 0pt; margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; border: 0pt none; display: block; float: left;" src="http://thumbs.zemanta.com/77611358.jpg" alt="" /><a style="display: block;" href="http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2012/02/meet-the-asus-padfone-the-phone-thats-a-tablet-thats-a-notebook/">Meet the Asus PadFone, the Phone that's a Tablet that's a Notebook</a><span style="display: block; font-size: 12px; margin: 10px 0pt;">(wired.com)</span><br /><div style="clear: both;"><br /><br /><hr style="margin: 0pt;" /><br /><br /></div></li><br />	<li><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2012/02/27/asus-padfone-hands-on-video/" target="_blank">ASUS Padfone hands-on (video)</a> (engadget.com)</li><br />	<li><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/02/27/asus-officially-unveils-the-accessory-laden-padfone/" target="_blank">Asus Officially Unveils The Accessory-Laden Padfone</a> (techcrunch.com)</li><br />	<li><a href="http://reviews.cnet.com/8301-13970_7-57387216-78/asus-padfone-turducken-of-the-mobile-world-hands-on-video/?part=rss&subj=crave" target="_blank">Asus Padfone: Turducken of the mobile world (hands on, video)</a> (reviews.cnet.com)</li><br />	<li><a href="http://www.talkandroid.com/93444-asus-offers-sneak-peak-of-padfone/" target="_blank">Asus offers sneak peak of Padfone</a> (talkandroid.com)</li><br />	<li><a href="http://www.mobileinquirer.com/2012/asus-padfone-the-missing-link-between-smartphone-and-tablet/" target="_blank">ASUS Padfone The Missing Link Between Smartphone And Tablet?</a> (mobileinquirer.com)</li><br />	<li style="overflow: hidden; list-style: none outside none; margin-top: 10px;"><br /><div style="clear: both;"><br /><br /><hr style="margin: 0pt;" /><br /><br /></div></li><br /></ul><br /><div style="margin-top: 10px; height: 15px;"><a title="Enhanced by Zemanta" href="http://www.zemanta.com/"><img class="zemanta-pixie-img" style="float: right;" src="http://img.zemanta.com/zemified_e.png?x-id=29de2e6d-8b63-44a9-a14a-19a0b9518254" alt="Enhanced by Zemanta" /></a></div>
