<a href="http://www.jlgatewood.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/millimeter-wave-scanner.jpg"><img class="alignleft" style="margin: 5px;" src="http://www.jlgatewood.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/millimeter-wave-scanner.jpg" alt="" width="196" height="162" /></a> The TSA is catchin' all kinds of hell after installing those scanners that see "only skin deep" to check and see if there is a weapons imprint... <a name='more'></a> Now I really see nothing appealing about this picture that it produces... I mean even if Beyoncé were to step up and get scanned in my line, I really can't get titilatted about something that looks like a half-baked MRI.  But whatever. If anything, this will prove to y'all that that isn't a shotgun in my pocket, and yes I'm happy to see you. ;)  And now for some jokes from a twitter account "pretending" to be the TSA...  Yeah, like the US government is that up-to-date to give every department a twitter account... They probably call the Department of the Interior's accounting office to make sure tweeting doesn't somehow tax the bird santuary budget or something....
