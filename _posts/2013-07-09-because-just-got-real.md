<img class="zemanta-img-inserted zemanta-img-configured alignleft" title="English: family vacation summer 2007" src="http://jlgatewood.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/300px-Studio1752.jpg" alt="English: family vacation summer 2007" width="300" height="225" />Sorry I haven't been posting as much as usual, but I'm in the "work until you drop" part of my teaching  job right now.  I'm grading tests like mad before summer vacation starts in 2 weeks, so coverage will be spotty until July 17th or so.

But something special will start right around that time, so please visit the site around then, OK?
