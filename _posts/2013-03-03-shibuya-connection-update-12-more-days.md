<em>These are a series of posts I've been making to the <a href="http://www.skyscrapercity.com/showpost.php?p=100839200&amp;postcount=1388" target="_blank">Skyscraper City/Japan Transport Forum</a>. I've been a huge train/LRT/tram nut since I was a kid and learned how to take the NYC subway by myself...  My local train line here in Yokohama is getting a major upgrade, and I've been following the progress. You can check them all out by following the tag <a href="http://jlgatewood.com.previewdns.com/tag/shibuya-connection/" target="_blank">Shibuya Connection</a> on my blog here. I'll be adding the prior posts as well so by the time 3/16 rolls around, there'll be a detailed history of how the changes were made to the railway that everyone can see easily. </em>

<em><strong>Super-Long Toyoko-Fukutoshin Connection Update!</strong></em>

With just 12 more days to go until the connection between the <a class="zem_slink" title="Tōkyū Tōyoko Line" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T%C5%8Dky%C5%AB_T%C5%8Dyoko_Line" rel="wikipedia" target="_blank">Tokyu Toyoko line</a> and the Tokyo Metro Fukutoshin line is made, there are some huge changes being made.

<strong>Tokyu Toyoko Shibuya Terminal receives its last station melody</strong>
For years, most Toyoko line riders would hear this melody played just prior to the announcement of arrivals and departures in Shibuya Terminal.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQQSzTrGo2g
<em>This was in use just prior to the Great Eastern Japan Earthquake...</em>

Even the JR station next door used it for their departing melody for a time.

<em>JR Shibuya melody</em>

Well on Friday, my ears heard a completely different tune while on my daily commute.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5HGLw-2pCE
<em> Go to the 1 minute mark in this video.</em>

New melody ｢Final approach」along with a 9000 series arriving.

Kinda made me a little sad because I knew exactly why the melody changed.

I went to Tokyu's website and found this info...
<pre><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Time period</span>：2013/3/1/ ～ 3/15
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Song Title</span>：｢Final approach」
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Artist</span>：Minoru Mukaiya
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Song Image</span>："I've tried to recreate the feeling of the final train to arrive on the platform here... The notes reflect the respect of the curtain closing on 85 years of history at Shibuya Terminal."</pre>
There will be a new melody being played on the Toyoko line at platforms 3 &amp; 4 downstairs on the B5 level when the switch is made on 3/16...
<pre><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Time period</span> ：2013/3/16 ~
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Song title</span> ：「Departing from New Shibuya Terminal」
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Artist</span>：Minoru Mukaiya
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Song Image</span>：Here I'm trying to produce the feeling of "Here we go!" upon leaving the underground <a class="zem_slink" title="Shibuya Station" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=35.658514,139.70133&amp;spn=0.01,0.01&amp;q=35.658514,139.70133 (Shibuya%20Station)&amp;t=h" rel="geolocation" target="_blank">Shibuya station</a> and ascending upwards out of the tunnel into <a class="zem_slink" title="Daikanyamachō, Shibuya" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=35.6516666667,139.705555556&amp;spn=0.01,0.01&amp;q=35.6516666667,139.705555556 (Daikanyamach%C5%8D%2C%20Shibuya)&amp;t=h" rel="geolocation" target="_blank">Daikanyama</a>. The modulation and peaking of the notes should reflect this.</pre>

The coolest thing about these melodies is that Japanese jazz keyboardist <a class="zem_slink" title="Minoru Mukaiya" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minoru_Mukaiya" rel="wikipedia" target="_blank">Minoru Mukaiya</a> from the band "Cassiopeia" made them. He's also really famous in railfan circles because he is also the producer of the train simulator game, Train Simulator and even produced several railfanning events for Tokyu. He has made a lot of catchy melodies heard in the stations around Japan for example the jingle on Keisei's Sky Express and Hanshin's mainline stations.

Check out his <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minoru_Mukaiya" target="_blank">Wikipedia page</a> for more info about him and the melodies he's made. (I updated that page to add these new tunes for him!

<strong>Most timetables for the upcoming 3/16 connection are online!</strong>

Tokyu was first to publish their timetables. They've even been taping them to the station's timetable boards so that everyone will know what to do on the first Monday of service (3/18). Indeed, we'll have the most adjusting to do because all of our trains are going to be stopping at different times, have more cars, and for those like me who continue on past Shibuya, will need to get a Tokyo Metro schedule to see if it even makes sense to stay on, or hop on another service...

So here are the new links to the changed timetables for those who like to check them out.

<a href="http://transfer.navitime.biz/tokyu/pc/diagram/TrainInfoStation?rrCd=00000790&amp;revisionId=10000091" target="_blank">Tokyu Toyoko Line</a> -- They've moved their new revisions into Navitime's software so now you can click on a time and see the entire diagram for that run. Tokyu wins again, and that's why they're my favorite Kanto train company.

<strong>A new 5050-4000 train is used to promote Shibuya Hikarie</strong>

I actually need to thank Quashlo for posting the Train Frontview icons site. I was looking through there and noticed a train called "Shibuya Hikarie号" and thought "WTF is that?" So I Googled and <a target="_blank">got this:</a>

Quote:
<blockquote>To celebrate the first anniversary of the opening of Hikarie Shibuya, "Shibuya Hikarie" train special edition will debut on Friday, April 26.

<img src="http://jlgatewood.com.previewdns.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/ZCnxEsj1.jpg" alt="ZCnxEsj.jpg" /></blockquote>
The exterior is wrapped in the design of the new landmark Shibuya Hikarie in gold...

The interior design has adopted three types of motifs in various clors. back and headrests are fitted as an improvement to standard design, an LED interior lighting is fitted with the environment in mind. In addition to normal runs along the Toyoko Line, the "Shibuya Hikarie" trainset is scheduled to be worked at train enthusiast events. more information will be forthcoming such as information on events and the vehicle manufacturing process.

...And I just remembered posting about J-TRAC (<a class="zem_slink" title="Tokyu Car Corporation" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyu_Car_Corporation" rel="wikipedia" target="_blank">Tokyu Car</a> Co) still owed us a few more 4000 series sets... Looks like the rumors were true and they'll be fitting the newer models with upgrades galore. How appropiate that the motif is gold...

<strong>Last train into "Old" Shibuya Terminal and switchover details are online</strong>

It goes without saying that there'll be TONS of railfans documenting the entire process in the wee hours of March 15/16...I'll likely be one of them if I can get enough sleep the day before. Tokyu has been kind enough to <a target="_blank">publish a timetable to show when the last train into Shibuya will be</a>.

Looks like they'll run an express starting at Motomachi-Chukagai at 12:05am that will then turn into a local past Musashi-Kosugi station at 12:30. (I think that train normally goes out of service there at that time.) It will pull into Shibuya station at 12:49am...and promptly go back down the line out-of-service since they'll be starting the process to switch the tracks. There's another train scheduled after this one, but it'll end at Naka-Meguro. There will be a bus bridge to ferry passengers to Daikanyama and Shibuya.

<strong>Changes seen on the Toyoko Line</strong>

Last time I showed Shibuya~Jiyuu-ga-oka, so this time I'll do Tamagawa~Yokohama with the help from <a target="_blank">Freepass-Nikki</a> blog...

<em><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a class="zem_slink" title="Tamagawa Station (Tokyo)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamagawa_Station_%28Tokyo%29" rel="wikipedia" target="_blank">Tamagawa Station</a></span></em>

Platform extensions are complete. Lighting, signage, PA speakers, fencing and flooring finishes are done. The only thing left now is for the ITV screens for the conductors to see the entire platform.

<em><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a class="zem_slink" title="Musashi-Kosugi Station" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musashi-Kosugi_Station" rel="wikipedia" target="_blank">Musashi-Kosugi Station</a></span></em>

There's a large shopping mall called Tokyu Square that's being built on top of this station and it'll open at nearly the same time as the new connection.

<img src="http://jlgatewood.com.previewdns.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/2013-02-23T164242-b780b1.jpgca2" alt="2013-02-23T16:42:42-b780b.jpg?c=a2" />

Here the scaffolding from the new escalators that go from platform up into the mall are being removed a bit. There's a ticketing mezzanine up there now but it'll open with the mall.

<img src="http://jlgatewood.com.previewdns.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/2013-02-23T164246-be10e1.jpgca2" alt="2013-02-23T16:42:46-be10e.jpg?c=a2" />

Just beyond, the new platforms have received their ITV screens.

<em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Hiyoshi Station</span></em>

<img src="http://jlgatewood.com.previewdns.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/2013-02-23T164247-9d1381.jpgca2" alt="2013-02-23T16:42:47-9d138.jpg?c=a2" />

They've added the ITV monitors down on the Shibuya/Wako-shi bound side extensions for 10 car trains. Again, this platform is temporary because in 3 years, they'll need to rearrange things at this end for the Sotetsu line link that will pop out of a tunnel just beyond where that Meguro Line train is laying over.

<img src="http://jlgatewood.com.previewdns.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/2013-02-23T164248-540a41.jpgca3" alt="2013-02-23T16:42:48-540a4.jpg?c=a3" />

At the other end, they've finally placed proper "TY" stopping markers on the floor. This lets us know where to line up for the train. The 8 car marks are down, and the 10 car marks are covered up for now. Also this end will get the "Ladies Car" marks (car #1) as well. They're on car #4 now.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>Kikuna Station</em></span>

<img src="http://jlgatewood.com.previewdns.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/2013-02-23T164250-3e8761.jpgca2" alt="2013-02-23T16:42:50-3e876.jpg?c=a2" />

This is a long(er) station with its gate all the way at the other end of the platform since it needs to connect to the JR Yokohama line station down there. They've roofed the whole platform and extension and added ITV. Still need to add signage and lighting down there but that will take no time at all.

I wonder if they can make a north entrance now-- there's a footbridge that crosses over the station at the halfway point... I feel bad for those getting off here from car #1 of a 10-car train!

<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>Yokohama Station</em></span>

<img src="http://jlgatewood.com.previewdns.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/m_DSCF40411.jpgca3" alt="m_DSCF4041.jpg?c=a3" />

Nothing much to be done here except place 10-car boarding markers on the ground (covered up for now.) They still have yet to replace the LED signboards and signage over to the "new style" here... But again, that should take a night of work once they get started.

<strong>Should I try and be a "rabid" railfan and take pix of the changeover?</strong>

I have some friends that want to try, so my personal plan is to take the last train into Shibuya station and see if there's some ceremony or something. Then walk from Shibuya station to Daikanyama and take pictures of the actual switching process...If there isn't some huge barrier preventing me from shooting pictures. If all goes well and my stamina is good, I'll ride the first train from Daikanyama (or walk to Naka-Meguro) and get some pictures of the newly switched over Shibuya station.

<strong>What are your personal opinions about the new service</strong>

I'm putting this here as a response to some of the feedback I've been getting from some friends that are into this stuff--and some who just need the train to get from point A to B. Some of them are wary of our beloved Toyoko line becoming susceptible to mishaps upstream-- Things that happen in Saitama to the Seibu and Tobu lines can now impact us in Yokohama for instance. This is a real issue for those who take JR's lines for instance because there's no built-in redundancy to operate each segment independent of each other in the event of a shutdown. But I remind them what happened in the days after the Great East Japan Earthquake when mutual service was suspended across the board for all lines for 3 weeks. The Fukutoshin-Toyoko connection is probably the first thru-service line here in Tokyo that is designed for these situations chiefly. I've been told by Tokyu staff that they can shunt operations down in sections until all their trains are back on Tokyu tracks and just use Shibuya as a terminus again until the timetables can be mated again in 30 minutes.

I'm also a little biased here--it works for me, and this is actually the reason I moved to this part of Yokohama 2 years ago. I knew this was coming and decided to stick it out. My job is in Ikebukuro and Shiki, two places well served by this connection. But I wanted to be close to Shibuya and the rest of central Tokyo *and* downtown Yokohama since I have family in the area.
