I couldn't imagine being born in a world before the automobile, radio, and in her time electricity was something only 1/3 of most americans had.  she's seen the rise and fall of the streetcar, stock market and 2 world wars.  talking to her I get the biggest idea of where I came from and where I'm headed.  happy birthday granny!</p><p align='right'><a target="_blank" href="http://www.shozu.com/?utm_source=upload_tag&utm_medium=graphic"><img border="0" alt="Posted by ShoZu" src="http://www.jlgatewood.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/logo_blog.gif" /></a></p><br /></div><br />
