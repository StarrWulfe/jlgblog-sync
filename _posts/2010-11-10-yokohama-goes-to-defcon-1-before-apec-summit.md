They got Yokohama's downtown area lookin' like Marshall Law just got instated over there. Here's a few things I saw that they're doing that seem a little like overkill in my book... But better safe than sorry, I guess.<br /><ul><br />	<li>If you're a resident of the area where the conference will be held, then you MUST wear an ID badge (人民表) in plain site at all times.</li><br />	<li>The coin lockers in every train station are sealed for the duration of the conference...  And I mean every train station within a 10 km distance...  Thats Yokohama, Kawasaki, stations too-- quite far from that venue...  Someone wanna let me know about Shinjuku, Shinagawa and some other ones too?</li><br />	<li>The elevated expressways in the area will be closed intermenttently to traffic... This happens in the States when the President rolls thru...  But usually for 15 minutes at a time...  Not 4 days...</li><br />	<li>They have cops on loan from various parts of Japan too... And they even ran outta patrol cars and vans-- so they have some rental cars with "POLICE" written on them in vinyl...  I'm not kiddin'...</li><br /></ul><br /><blockquote>YOKOHAMA--Yokohamas Minato Mirai district has been on high alert since Sunday, when a series of meetings of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum began.<br /><br />On Sunday, watchful police officers seemed omnipresent as a large number of tourists and families visited the district. I myself was questioned by a police officer near a ticket wicket at JR Sakuragicho Station, which is the gateway to the Minato Mirai district. It was because I had a camera dangling from my shoulder. After I told the police officer I was a news reporter, the officer explained he had stopped me because, "There are various shapes of bombs. "The keys to all the coin lockers in the station have been removed to make them unusable. A station worker was sealing covers over fire hydrants. "This is to prevent bombs from being hidden inside," he said.<br /><br />Queens Square Yokohama, a shopping mall with about 200 clothing shops, restaurants and other stores, is located between Sakuragicho Station and the Pacifico Yokohama conference center, which accommodates the APEC meetings. The number of shoppers there seemed to be only about 60 percent or 70 percent of that on a usual holiday, but the shopping mall was still crowded.<br /><br />Police officers eagerly yet politely questioned passersby for the sake of security in the crowded places. "Please cooperate, because the APEC meetings are being held," they said while approaching people.Akemi Shinzato, a 19-year-old model who had come on a shopping trip from Joso, Ibaraki Prefecture, voiced her frustration by saying: "I see police officers everywhere. It seems that all the trash bins were also removed."Police were examining cars at more than 10 traffic checkpoints in the Minato Mirai district. Although the officers were looking into car trunks, there were no remarkable traffic jams.Yokohama Cosmoworld, an amusement park near the APEC venue, was less crowded than usual, as were stores in the Yokohama Red Brick Warehouse complex.<br /><br />Kazuki Murakami, a 45-year-old bicycle taxi driver, who was waiting for a customer near the Yokohama Red Brick Warehouse, said, "Though there are fewer visitors [right now], the APEC meets are an opportunity for the rest of the world to know about Yokohama."<br /><br />via <a href="http://www.yomiuri.co.jp/dy/national/T101108005100.htm">Yokohama on high alert as APEC meets start : National : DAILY YOMIURI ONLINE The Daily Yomiuri</a>, by Takaaki Suzuki / Yomiuri Shimbun Staff Writer</blockquote><br />So what is this APEC thing and why is there so much security surrounding it anyway?  Let's find out.<br /><p style="text-align: center;">[lightbox href=http://in.reuters.com/resources_v2/flash/video_embed.swf?videoId=164059928]</p><br /><br /><br />[caption id="attachment_1265" align="aligncenter" width="150" caption="click here for video"]<img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-1265" title="japan-police-apec2010" src="http://www.jlgatewood.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/japan-police-apec2010-150x150.png" alt="" width="150" height="150" />[/caption]<br /><br />[/lightbox]
