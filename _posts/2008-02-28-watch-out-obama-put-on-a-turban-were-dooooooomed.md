><a href="javascript:pop_windowCartoon('http%3A//www.politico.com/cartoon/index.html',635,515)"><img src="http://www.jlgatewood.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/080226_edtoon2-26_336.jpg" alt="Chapeauphobia" align="left" border="0" height="272" width="336" /></a>Why the hell is it that Americans call ourselves the most progressive, inclusive, non-judgemental society on Earth, but let someone who just happens to be running for president be seen in a picture wearing the garb of the locals in a country he's visiting, and let that dress look like something certain "enemies of the state" would also be wearing, and then that person is labeled a "terrorist sympathizer".<br /><br />This is nuts.  Someone in the Clinton camp let a photo of Barack Obama while on tour in Somalia be misconstrued into him being associated with terrorists.  Umm right, so that means that when I am in Japan, and dressed in a karate gi, or jinbe or men's kimono, that must mean I am a Asian Nationalist and if this were 1941, then I would be seen as a sympathizer too... <br /><br />This is ludacris, and now it only shows that Clinton is grasping at straws--whatever it takes for her to win.  She's no different then the Bush campaigns of 2000 and 2004 at this point.  I'm not for that talk.
