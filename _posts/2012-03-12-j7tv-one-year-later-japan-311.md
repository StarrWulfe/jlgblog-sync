http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5ngwbKH-S0<br /><br />I'm talking about what happened to me personally in the time since the Great East Japan Disasters a year ago.  I tried 3 times to type out my feelings... and it just wouldn't come out, so I just turned on my webcam and went "<a title="Stream of consciousness (narrative mode)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stream_of_consciousness_%28narrative_mode%29" rel="wikipedia" target="_blank">stream-of-consciousness</a>" with my thoughts. I'm sorry for being long and random... but I needed to do this.  Please comment and give me your thoughts, concerns, questions, etc... And please donate time, money, and PRAYERS to TOHOKU.<br /><div style="margin-top: 10px; height: 15px;"><a title="Enhanced by Zemanta" href="http://www.zemanta.com/"><img class="zemanta-pixie-img" style="border: none; float: right;" src="http://img.zemanta.com/zemified_e.png?x-id=f6108cd5-1f89-4120-b0f2-8d629a0c8e6e" alt="Enhanced by Zemanta" /></a></div>
