The "Shibuya Connection" opens March 16th. Are you ready?

Wait. What's this "Shibuya Connection" you speak of, a new James Bond movie title? As cool as that would be to have Ian Fleming's next spy thriller shot here in Tokyo, this is actually the title given for something more helpful to us Tokyoites; the new tunnel that will link two of the Metropolis' busiest lines, Tokyo Metro's <a class="zem_slink" title="Tokyo Metro Fukutoshin Line" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo_Metro_Fukutoshin_Line" rel="wikipedia" target="_blank">Fukutoshin line</a>, and Tokyu's <a class="zem_slink" title="Tōkyū Tōyoko Line" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T%C5%8Dky%C5%AB_T%C5%8Dyoko_Line" rel="wikipedia" target="_blank">Toyoko line</a>.

The Toyoko line has been shuttling people back and forth between Tokyo and Yokohama from Shibuya since 1927. You may have never used it before unless you live along its route, but not only does it give the quickest and cheapest ride to Yokohama from Tokyo, it also passes along many trendy neighborhoods, and together with its extension called the <a class="zem_slink" title="Minatomirai Line" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minatomirai_Line" rel="wikipedia" target="_blank">Minato-Mirai line</a>, allows one to visit Yokohama's developing harbor area, Minato-Mirai, and also it's Chinatown, Motomachi-Chukagai.

It's slated to be connected to Tokyo's newest subway route, the Fukutoshin line in the wee hours of March 16. Because of this, the Toyoko line's 4 track elevated station will go dark after 50 years of service; the new tunnel goes between <a class="zem_slink" title="Daikan-yama Station" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=35.648038,139.703205&amp;spn=0.01,0.01&amp;q=35.648038,139.703205 (Daikan-yama%20Station)&amp;t=h" rel="geolocation" target="_blank">Daikanyama station</a> to the underground Fukutoshin line <a class="zem_slink" title="Shibuya Station" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=35.658514,139.70133&amp;spn=0.01,0.01&amp;q=35.658514,139.70133 (Shibuya%20Station)&amp;t=h" rel="geolocation" target="_blank">Shibuya station</a> that currently serves as that route's endpoint. Crews are working around the clock in the station to expand and add new entrances in order to take on the job of becoming the Toyoko line's connection.

The Fukutoshin line currently starts at Shibuya station, 30 meters underground. It travels up Meiji-Dori Boulevard and calls upon <a class="zem_slink" title="Harajuku" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harajuku" rel="wikipedia" target="_blank">Harujuku</a>, Shinjuku 3-chome, and Ikebukuro, before heading west into the Saitama 'burbs by splitting into the Seibu's Ikebukuro and Tobu's Tojo lines. In fact, you wouldn't be wrong to say it competes with the <a class="zem_slink" title="Yamanote Line" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yamanote_Line" rel="wikipedia" target="_blank">JR Yamanote line</a> because parallels the west side of the loop almost exactly. In fact this is exactly what Tokyo Metro, Tokyu, Seibu, and Tobu are all banking on--riders will save time, money, and nerves by using the new link instead.

The fastest trains will offer one-seat rides between Yokohama and Ikebukuro stations at around 38 minutes, compared to 59 minutes and one transfer now. Plus more trains will be added throughout the line to help ease crowding during the rush periods. Also the Toyoko line will be stretching its 8 car trains to 10 cars on express runs in order to help spread the load.

So now it seems getting between Japan's two largest cities just got a little bit easier!
