<p>Thinking about getting this camera now.  I am primarily a video shooter, but my roots are stills; I was craving the smell of fixer when I was 11 years old!   </p>
<p>My SLR was a Nikon 500-something.  I got it in 1997, and someone stole it outta my house 5 years later.  This year my camcorder broke while editing a music video--I was using it as a MiniDV deck; the footage was shot with an XL2 I borrowed.   </p>
<p>So now I need both a decent still camera, and a video camera-- I like interchangeable lenses and I don't want to deal with tapes anymore... HD quality is a must too.  I edit a magazine, and I also plan on doing more video content as well for it online in 2010...  So I need to make a decision soon. </p>
<p>Even though this looks like just another DSLR, this thing also shoots 1080p at 24p...  Better than the camera I had at Comcast!!  I can use external mics (a must as well...)  Plus its a 12.1MP DSLR camera...  And its the only one I know of that can shoot those 12.1MP stills WHILE shooting 1080p VIDEO....   </p>
<p>There goes ¥10k when I get my hands on it....  Check the vid below... </p>
