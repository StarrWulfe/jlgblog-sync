I was already complaining how Typhoon #9 (they don't name storms here like we do in the States) was puttin' a hurtin' on my plans...  I had planned on watchigng some summer fireworks on the river that separates Gifu and Aichi prefectures in a town called Inuyama.  But due to the horrendous flood-inducing, Noah-needs-to-build-another-Ark-inspiring rainfall, My plans got washed out-- pun very intentional.<br /><br />Then to make matters worse, at 5:07am, I was woken up to the worse quake I've felt since growing up in Los Angeles.  A 6.5 on the Richter scale.  It was centered in the bay off of Shizuoka prefecture, but it was deep-- 15 miles (20km) below the earth's surface.  It was a surreal feeling.  During the initial wave, I knew from instinct that it was a quake, but it didn't seem that bad at first.  About 5 seconds into it though, the surface waves hit, and violent shaking started.  I wanted to run or hide under something, but just as quickly as it started, it ended.<br /><br />Well needless to say, any major quake in Japan is treated with the upmost attention, thanks in part to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Hanshin_earthquake">Hanshin Quake of 1994</a>.  Lessons learned from the past have made a routine checking of everything from the railway system and highway structures, to utilities and buildings, a through process.  Oh and just so you know, they shut down EVERYTHING while this is happening.  So no train service, and no freeway for you until its checked out.  It's a minor inconvenience maybe, but I can handle it-- make sure it safe BEFORE I ride!!
