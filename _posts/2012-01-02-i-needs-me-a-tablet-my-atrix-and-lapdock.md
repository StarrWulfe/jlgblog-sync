I needs me a tablet.  My atrix and lapdock are cool, but I've been really looking hard at this combo for a while...  What do y'all think? Or should I eat more Apple pie and just grab an iPad?<br /><a name='more'></a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.androidcentral.com/asus-transformer-prime-review">ASUS Transformer Prime review | Android Central</a><br /><br /><img src="http://www.jlgatewood.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/containerfocusgadgetaresize_h100urlhttp%3A%2F%2Fcdn.androidcentral.com%2Fsites%2Fandroidcentral.com%2Ffiles%2Fimagecache%2Fw550h500%2Fpostimages%2F684%2Fasus-transformer-prime-review-45.jpg" /><br /><br />There's also one other combination too. EMobile here in Japan recently started a really good promo that sounds <del>good</del> perfect. <br /><br />They have a Huawei Honor Android smartphone that they'll allow you to tether up to 5 other devices with no extra hidden data charges. Just ¥4000/month. <br /><br />For voice, they have a plan where you can make up to 300 10 minute calls a month for the flat fee of ¥1500. This may sound weird but it makes perfect sense to me; I'm hardly ever calling out to someone longer than 10 minutes at a time-- and when I did, its only been 5 times in the last 3 YEARS! (also I asked and they say it's perfectly ok to hang up at 9:59 and redial!) Now remember, in Japan you don't pay for INCOMING calls. And I usually try to use Viber, Skype, or Google Talk for calls to other smartphones.  <br /><br />So-- I can have portable Internet, cheap calls, AND did I mention that Emobile doesn't SIMLock their phones? So I can pop in a T-mobile or AT&T simcard when I go home too.
