2010 almost gone/can't beleve how much time has flown/amazing how people I hate won't leave me alone/the ones I like ain't never home/at times mad enough to make my mouth foam/2010 was a sadness that never should've been shown/But in the end I seemed to have grown/partial to the solitude feeling of a lone/wolf in sheeps clothing that's forced to roam/amongst the fields ripe for planting the seeds that I've sewn.<br /><br />Holla back if you feelin' any of this... Or if you think its straight garbage... Whatevs.
