>Well one thing about myself I do like-- I don't stay down for very long.  Yeah I've been going through some ill s*** lately (see the previous post) but at this point, I am looking at some of the things that are going right for a change.<br /><br /><ul><li>A <a href="http://streetsidemedia.com/joomla/news/latest/love.said.no-video-premiere.html">music video I shot</a> in collaboration with a buddy of mine is probably gonna get aired on the international music channels... </li><li>The <a href="http://streetsidemedia.com/joomla/gallery/film--video-gallery/the-playpen.html">movie I shot last year </a>is finally done...  Now we just have to shop it around and get some sort of deal.</li><li><a href="http://www.streetsidemedia.com/">StreetSide Media</a> is becoming well-known around here...  Went to a few places in the past week and broke out my demo or business card, and a few people already knew about us.  Not bad!</li></ul><br />I still have no job...  but then again I do--StreetSide-- I just need to start the hustle so it can be a sole source of revenue for us.<br /><a href="http://www.html-kit.com/favicon/download/nocache-191513616/temp-1bf422aeae841c63ec96643f83b2313f/favicon.ico" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://www.html-kit.com/favicon/download/nocache-191513616/temp-1bf422aeae841c63ec96643f83b2313f/favicon.ico" /></a>You know, I never used to really believe in the devil; I still don't.  But I do believe in negative energy and that's everywhere right now.  To avoid it, surround yourself with positive energy and feelings.
