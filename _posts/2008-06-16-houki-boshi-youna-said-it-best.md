See a few posts back about the Bleach season 3 ending.  Even with my horrible Japanese ability, this song spoke to me, and inspired the post before this one.<br /><br />This song is about someone wanting to turn into a comet so that the light would always be next to the person she loved.  Somehow before I translated this song for myself, I felt that's what it meant.  And somehow I used to say that to the person I loved.<br /><br />So to my little star that probably never thinks of me anymore, if I turn into a comet-- I can fly by you all the time and we'll both light the heavens someday.<br /><br />放棄防止になりたい、恋星に飛びろう！いっつかに探してるじゃん。<br /><br /></div>
