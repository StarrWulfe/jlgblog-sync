That means its almost cherry blossom time in Japan again...  And this is the time I love most in Japan, so I'm on the hunt for cheap-ass tix to get over there...  This pic is for my boy BreakDown...  He ate so much Dango in Oji when we were there, I thought he was gonna marry the woman selling them in the train station!!</p>
