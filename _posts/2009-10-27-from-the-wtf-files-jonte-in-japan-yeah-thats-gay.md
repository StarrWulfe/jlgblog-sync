>Never heard of this guy until I open up YouTube and see this as a "suggested watch" in the sidebar.

Wanna tell me who this dude is?!? <p /> <object height="417" width="500"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/4QD5HnIUF4c&hl=en&fs=1" /><param name="wmode" value="window" /><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/4QD5HnIUF4c&hl=en&fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" height="417" wmode="window" width="500"></embed></object>      <p style="font-size: 8px;">  <a href="http://posterous.com">Posted via email</a>   from <a href="http://starrwulfe.posterous.com/from-the-wtf-files-jonte-in-japanyeah-thats-g">...all about starrwulfe...</a>  </p>
