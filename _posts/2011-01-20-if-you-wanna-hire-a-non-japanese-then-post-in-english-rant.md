I'll probably never be able to get a job at GREE behind this, but this is semi-typical of what I've run into here in Japan when looking for jobs in my field (Multimedia/Web/Audio-Video Development)<br /><br />There are these HUGE companies here, and they're struggling to find a way to branch out because the home market is SATURATED.  Japan's population is slowly declining and they're looking at ways to market their tech outside the country...  So they say they want to hire some foreign staff.  Here's the posting for some of those IT those jobs by Japan's largest social media outfit GREE...<br /><br />http://twitter.com/#!/tanakayoshikazu/status/26868987274989568<br /><img src="http://www.jlgatewood.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Screen_shot_2011-01-20_at_1.27.08_AM.png" /><br /><br />But in the words of my father, the approach is rather "half-assed"...<br /><br />http://twitter.com/#!/localjapantimes/status/27743709554540544<br /><br />I mean BOOM...  I can't put it any plainer than that...  Wait, yeah I can--<br /><br />http://twitter.com/#!/StarrWulfe/status/27751454781476864<br /><br />But remember, I'm not the one that just doles out empty complaints into the ether...  So I asked the GREE bossman himself...<br /><br />http://twitter.com/#!/StarrWulfe/status/27751096432730112<br /><br />[box] TRANSLATION: Excuse me Mr Tanaka, but I have a recruiting question...  Do the postions for foreigners that have been posted require some sort of Japanese fluency?  Because the posting PR itself is all in Japanese... <br /><br />WHAT I REALLY WANNA SAY:  How the HELL are foreigners gonna apply for a job that's only on the JAPANESE side of your website, and what if they can't frikkin' read JAPANESE?!? [/box]<br /><br />Seriously, this needs to end... if they are serious about really hiring a Non-Japanese to help manage their expansion outside of Japan, then there are <a href="http://gaijinpot.com">tons</a> <a href="http://www.japantimes.co.jp/jobs/start_e.html">of</a> <a href="http://www.seekjapan.jp/jobs">websites</a> and recruiting companies to post jobs on here in Japan that cater to that audience...  There's even this one <a href="http://ranmagazine.com">magazine that I work with</a>....  <br /><br />And even their wikipedia page is in Japanese ONLY...  That'd be the first thing I'd tackle if they hired me to do their online international presence...  Make them an English entry...<br /><br />http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/GREE<br />[wikibox lang="ja"]GREE[/wikibox]<br /><br />The time is now Japan...  Make an effort to hire us for MORE than teaching our native language please...  Some of us got off the plane with other talents we're good at too... ;)
