http://www.ustream.tv/recorded/11112762<br /><p style="text-align: justify;"></p><br /><p style="text-align: justify;">Guess who was on TV this past Saturday? Well sort of.  My buddy Katz of YokosoNews is working with us at RANmagazine to start doing some internet broadcasting of our events...  And in return, we're going to help provide a "Gaijin Eye for the Japanese Guy" sort of coverage for his events...  It's RANmagazine's first syndication deal, and definitely won't be the last!  Anyway here's what we talked about on the show:<a name='more'></a></p><br /><a href="http://www.jlgatewood.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/weeklyyokoso.title2_.640.jpg"><img class="alignleft" style="margin: 4px;" src="http://www.jlgatewood.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/weeklyyokoso.title2_.640.jpg" alt="Jason and Katz on YokosoNews Weekly!" width="384" height="288" /></a><br /><br />Aired at 4pm on Sat Nov, 27 (JST), the weekly live streaming show to talk about what happened in Japan.<br /><br />In this week, the interesting findings on jobs, and travel in Japan. Also the most searched words of 2010 in Japan was revealed.<br /><br />Hey, we do this every weekend here from Central Japan; so tune in and catch us live.  We have Skype, Twitter and Facebook running too, so you can comment with us as the show is airing-- and perhaps end up ON the show as well, if you have a webcam.<br /><br />via <a href="http://yokosonews.com/news/yokosonews-weekly-002/">YokosoNews Weekly - Work, Travel and Ranking :: YokosoNews - Japanese Culture, Lifestyle and Entertainment</a>.
