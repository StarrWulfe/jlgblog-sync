So I call myself being chivalrous and take my date back to her house last night in my car because she missed her last train home. Now remember kids, Tokyo + driving anywhere = issues all the time for me. Besides racking up ¥1000 in tolls each way to take her home from Yokohama (which ain't bad because of the discounts actually) and me getting lost in her area because we couldn't find the right exit off the tollway, the Shobousha Avengers decided to show up and do battle!  ...and I'm forced to stay-- watch the video.
