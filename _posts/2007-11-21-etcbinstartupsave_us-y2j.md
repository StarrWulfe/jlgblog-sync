There are only 3 things I watch on TV with any regularity... Anime, TLC/Discover, and WWE... And if you know me, you know I take wrestling seriously. It's all about the performance, and in-ring skills... But its about the mic-skills to back it up.

Five mat-jockeys come to mind when I think about "wrasslin'" today:  The Rock, John Cena, DX (HHH and HBK) and Y2J-Chris Jericho.   Well guess what.

RAW is Jericho once again!!  What next--  ...come on Rock...  come on, just gimme a "people's elbow" just for laughs one more time!!
