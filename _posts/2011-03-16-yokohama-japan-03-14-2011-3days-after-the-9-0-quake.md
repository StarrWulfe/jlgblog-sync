So we are going start a RAN donation drive.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.ranmagazine.com/sendai-quake-donations/">http://www.ranmagazine.com/sendai-quake-donations/</a><br /><br />All proceeds will be distributed to various relief organizations that we've partnered with in the past for our previous charity events like RAN Rock Haiti, RAN for Chile and recently, RAN for Christchurch.<br /><br />RAN Magazine is putting together a team of people to offer support / go to Sendai and help. Watch our twitter feeds and/or check the donation site for more details about when we can enter the affected areas as a group. Thank you so much!<br /><br /></div><br />Â <br /><br /></div>
