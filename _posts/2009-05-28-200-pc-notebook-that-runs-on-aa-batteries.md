Yup, I'm getting one.  I need a laptop that I can take around to events and to the job to make worksheets for students, and also be able to surf the internet.  This'll do.  The fact that it runs for 4 hours on off-the-shelf NiMH AA rechargables that I can find in any 100 shop here is excellentor denki-ya san (electronics store) is worth it to me...  My 2 year old HP dv2000 has a recalled battery pack and motherboard right now...  *sigh*</p></div>
