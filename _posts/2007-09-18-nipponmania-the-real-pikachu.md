><div></div> <br /><br />Yes, there really is a person paid to make all those pokemon sounds-- even if all they say is one word, someone's gotta do it.<br /><br />Her name is Ikuya Ohtani, and she's the voice of that cute hampster with the power of lightning, Pikachu.  She even looks a lil' bit like Pikachuu, right?  Well I think she's cute, and has a cute voice too.
