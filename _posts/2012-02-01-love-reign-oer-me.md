A girl once asked me what I thought love was... ...I told her, I can't put it into words, but listen to this song with your eyes closed... listen to that piano and the crescendo of the cymbals. Listen to Roger's raspy voice, and the pounding of the drums against the crying guitar.<br /><p style="text-align: right;">...This is love.</p><br />...Good Night from Yokohama.<br /><br />Â
