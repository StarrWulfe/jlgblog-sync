Oh, I want y'all to know I love my hometown, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St.%20Louis%2C%20Missouri">St Louis, Missouri</a>....  River City, Mound City, Gateway-to-the-West...  Those of us from "The 'Lou" have a really bad "short-man" complex; we hate not being noticed, not coming out on top...  That's why we forever cheer for the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFEHtvzSClA">Cards</a>, and the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y97C3FaAn3Y">Rams.</a>..  It's why you'll meet folks like me who know about hockey too--even though I'm a black dude.  I love <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/vironevaeh/1795540830/">University of Missouri football</a>, and <a href="http://www.scottradecenter.com/images/event-pix/SLU_300.jpg">SLU basketball</a>...  And yeah, I'll say "St Louis SUCKS" about 50 times a day, but YOU better not say it-- you ain't from there, so don't be talkin' 'bout what you don't know!<br /><br />Let me address something though on the serious tip though...  St Louis needs to come in LAST one one particular list.  Many may not know it, but St Louis has been on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/America%27s%20Safest%20and%20Most%20Dangerous%20Cities">FBI's Most Dangerous City list</a> ever since I can remember what FBI meant...  And that's a long ass time.<br /><blockquote><a href="http://www.startribune.com/nation/109732184.html#comments">St. Louis beats out Camden, NJ, to earn ranking as most dangerous US city; Detroit is 3rd | StarTribune.com</a>.<br /><div style="float: left; width: 100%;"><br /><p>Associated Press</p><br /><p>Last update: November 21, 2010 - 4:54 PM</p><br /><br /></div><br /><div><br /><div><br /><br />TRENTON, N.J. - A national study finds St. Louis overtook Camden, N.J., as the nation's most dangerous city in 2009.<br /><br />The study released Sunday by CQ Press found St. Louis had 2,070.1  violent crimes per 100,000 residents, compared with a national average  of 429.4. That helped St. Louis beat out Camden, which topped last  year's list and was the most dangerous city for 2003 and 2004.<br /><br />Detroit, Flint, Mich., and Oakland, Calif., rounded out the top five.<br /><br />For the second straight year, the safest city with more than 75,000 residents was Colonie, N.Y.<br /><br /></div><br /></div><br />The annual rankings are based on population figures and crime data  compiled by the FBI. Some criminologists question the findings, saying  the methodology is unfair.</blockquote><br />I don't know if the medodology is unfair or not-- I can tell you that most of the crime that I've ever bore direct witness to or was a victim of, happened in St Louis.  Mind you, I spent a vast majority of my life after the age of 10 years-old OUTSIDE of STL, only coming back to attend 2 years of high school in '93-'95 and again 2 years of university in '02-'04.  Here is a list of things that occured in that small block of time...<br /><br />Saw a guy get his @$$ BEAT in the alley behind my house one snowy night. He was a Blood in Crip territory...  My pop broke it up due to them tresspassing in our backyard-- with his shotgun.<br /><br />Had my car broken into and/or stolen 4 times.  Remember, I didn't have a car half my time there...<br /><br />Was almost carjacked twice. Good thing I'm a streetracer and couldn't give a damn whether I run a few red lights or hit someone trying to steal my $#¡†!  Even the police told me I did the right thing when I filed the report...<br /><br />The biggest thing-- My brother is in jail on manslaughter charges due to him coming home and getting stabbed by his live-in girlfriend who was high on various narcotics at the time. He tried to run away and she pulled a gun. In the ensuing struggle, the gun goes off,  the bullet deflects off the base of her skull...  She ends up in the hospital, and dies after 4 days. My brother was already on probation...  And even though HE was defending himself, and HE got stabbed a bunch of times, HE goes (back) to jail for 5 years...<br /><br />Remember, we're talking about St Louis CITY. The COUNTY of St Louis that surrounds the city is actually one of the SAFEST, most progressive urban areas in the country...  Whats up with the disparity?<br /><br />St Louis...  You have so much potiential to be a great city to raise kids in, and have an easy life...  But
