The blog will get moved over there-- but I'll just probably iFrame it because I'm way too lazy to try and set Wordpress up just for my own personal crap.  Blogger does a good job of what I need it to do, not to mention I use my Treo a lot to post live video and photos to it using Shozu or a direct email...  No need to re-invent the wheel for this thing, right?<br /><br /></div>
