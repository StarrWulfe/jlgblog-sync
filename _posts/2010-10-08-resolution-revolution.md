><div><span style="font-family: lucida grande, tahoma, verdana, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">I miss my family. I miss my friends, I miss my pets. I miss 200 different beers, 10 different flavors of hot wings, 2 brothers and one sis. I miss steak n&#39; shake with mom, benny&#39;s burritos with dad, and catfish and fries with granny and grandad. </span><p /><div><span style="font-family: lucida grande, tahoma, verdana, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">My life is good in Japan...  But there&#39;s this house next door...  And it&#39;s Nagoya-- 2 million strong,  big-ass city with like 120,000 people just in my WARD...  so houses are super-close. Walls are thinner than notebook paper.  So I can hear a gnat fart from four doors down!  Anyway, just trying to illustrate the point that I can hear a lot of the goings-on of this house next door. </span></div> <p /><div><span style="font-family: lucida grande, tahoma, verdana, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">There&#39;s a family-- Mom, Dad, and 2 small kids.  a girl and a boy.  And like most small kids, one minute they&#39;re laughing, crying the next...  But the parents are always playing with them.  The dad works some long hours I think.  I heard him complaining about it. (damn my Japanese is getting good if I can understand complaining while eavesdropping!) His son, who had gotta be just under 5 years-old or so, says, "well you gotta work. I wanna play with you everyday, but fathers must work." The dad says, "why do you think that?" "Because, that&#39;s how we get ice cream!" </span></div> <p /><div><span style="font-family: lucida grande, tahoma, verdana, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">I must have laughed for 20 minutes after that (and I&#39;m sure they heard me laughing...  and know why I was laughing...) But it made me homesick a little...  It reminded me of my parents, and grandparents...  It reminded me that my family is far away.  It made me jealous of my Japanese friends, and my students-- they can see their family anytime...  </span></div> <p /><div><span style="font-family: lucida grande, tahoma, verdana, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">...Then I realized why I sacrificed that feeling...</span></div> <p /><div><span style="font-family: lucida grande, tahoma, verdana, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">I have to have a better resolve.  I have to remember that I am here for something and I have to remember that I gave up a lot to get this far.  I have to make this thing I&#39;m after WORK.  I have to have RESOLVE. </span></div> <p /><div><span style="font-family: lucida grande, tahoma, verdana, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">If you go back to some of the earlier posts in this tome, you can see what I was going through then...  Trust and believe, it was a lot worse that what I could share on the net.  Now that I&#39;m back in Japan, the job is half over...  </span></div> <p /><div>...And the hard part is about to begin...  Coming here was liberating.  But true freedom lies in accomplishing the goal; becoming free to believe in one&#39;s self.  </div> <p /><div>I set a high goal, but that&#39;s ok.</div> <p /><div>I&#39;m not afraid of heights.</div><p style="font-size: 9px;">  Posted via email from <a href="http://starrwulfe.info/resolution-revolution">...all about starrwulfe...</a>  </p></div>
