><div><div>I know this is an iPad oriented article-- but this paragraph just applies to SO MANY people I encounter daily.  Change / Resistance x Ignorance = Devolution. <br /><blockquote>...It's important to understand who these people are. They're the same kind of people who said automobiles are just a fad, who said nobody wants to hear movie actors talk, who said graphical computing isn't real computing. They believe themselves to be enlightened skeptics. In fact, they're just the kind of people that always come out of the woodwork when something breathtakingly new emerges. They can't see -- refuse to see -- the obvious possibilities in the new because it threatens their advantages in the old.</blockquote><div>via <a href="http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/print/9175687/Why_the_iPad_is_a_creativity_machine?taxonomyName=Macintosh&taxonomyId=163"><img src="http://www.jlgatewood.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/computerworld_page_logo.gif" width="100" /></a></div>...wake up people and apply that statement to EVERYTHING AROUND YOU NOW.
