I ventured over into Roppongi district tonight with 5 other friends and stood in line for 45 minutes to check out this year's Christmas light show at the Tokyo Midtown office complex. This year, we were bathed in the azure and pearlesent glow of 20,000 LEDs all powered by solar energy. Check the video and the pictures below...

It was free to see, and the line wasn't so bad...I had 2 beers while waiting since the line went past a 7-11 inside the mall. Japan is very convenient for those of us who like adult beverages while cuing up.

Happening for two more days then its gone until December 2013!
