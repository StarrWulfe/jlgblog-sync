As an online media content creator, <br />I am expected to not only make compelling content but also help in the <br />marketing of it; i.e. getting eyeballs and earholes to see/hear the <br />site we've created. <br />I used to have to concentrate on getting people to want to be online <br />in the first place in those days. Just getting someone to visit my <br />site meant placing ads in trade magazines, or at the very least, doing <br />an email blast. <br />But now social sites are networking people together and all it takes <br />is me tweeting about our content to have eyes looking at it. Also with <br />content aggregation coming online, look to see your content being <br />syndicated across the web to other social sites either in real-time, <br />as a recommended post done by a bot, or by a human reposting or <br />retweeting your content (the best advertising is still word-of-mouth). <br />I've been testing this concept over the last two weeks with a service <br />called Posterous. I can post any content (including what you're <br />reading now) and it will crosspost this to my blog, my facebook page, <br />my linked in page, send out a tweet on Twitter about it, and more. If <br />I add some video, it gets posted to YouTube. Pictures get posted to <br />Flickr. And facebook and myspace get all media. <br />Best thing? I am doing most of this with my iPhone, either through <br />their app, or (like now) just sending a simple email to my posterous <br />account. <br />Now I am trying to figure out the interactive points. When people <br />comment on my content I've syndicated everywhere, I have to check a <br />million sites to answer each separate comment thread about the same <br />content. For example, this post is on facebook and my blog at <br /><a href="http://www.jlgatewood.com/">www.jlgatewood.com</a> <br />. It's also at www.starrwulfe.info too. It also generated a tweet <br />about it as well. If you comment on any of the sites, I have to <br />moderate them separately. Plus maybe a good comment that would benefit <br />the readers of one site will not be seen at another. Tweets come to <br />me, but it'd be cool for those to be placed in the comments thread as <br />well. Make the conversation on all sites reflect one main <br />conversation going on around that one syndicated crosspost. <br />So if you comment about this video on facebook, it shows up also in <br />the comments section of the video on YouTube.com. <br />Does something like that exist yet? Is someone working on it? How can <br />I help speed THAT up?<br /><br /><br /><a href="http://www.jlgatewood.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/avatar32.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="32" src="http://www.jlgatewood.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/avatar32.jpg" width="32" /></a><a href="http://www.jlgatewood.com/">www.JLGatewood.com</a> | <a href="http://www.streetsidemedia.com/">www.streetsidemedia.com</a> | <a href="http://www.ranmagazine.com/">www.ranmagazine.com</a>      <br /><div style="font-size: 9px;">Posted via email by J7  <br /></div>
