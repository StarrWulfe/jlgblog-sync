The death of Niccola Furlong here in Tokyo after a concert is raising plenty of questions; however the majority have nothing to do with the actual investigation, and everything to do with racism in and out of Japan, foreign policy, Japanese <a class="zem_slink" title="Forensic science" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forensic_science" rel="wikipedia" target="_blank">crime investigation</a> and policing methods.

The same shall apply to a person who commits an indecent act upon a male or female under thirteen years of age.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;UPDATE: New details in the Nicola Furlong death in TokyoI am sure that many of you are already familiar with the various details surrounding the death of the Irish foreign exchange student, Nic...&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;Here are the facts of the case&lt;/b&gt; so far --again courtesy of BlackTokyo.com, and MYSELF-- I actually talked to one of the sources in Kawasaki last night, and this all checks out.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;The 19-year-old is being identified via various blogs and online news sources as L. P. This IS NOT the previously named drummer that was MISTAKENLY reported on other blogs, including this one. Black Tokyo contacted the source of the previously reported information to notify said source of the error and to relay the source’s (and Black Tokyo’s) apology.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;The previously unidentified 21-year-old woman is S. M., as reported via&amp;nbsp;various&amp;nbsp;(corrected at 1700, 30 May 12. See Twitter inquiry below) a&amp;nbsp;media&amp;nbsp;source.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;According to another BT source, “L.P. and/or Blackstone supposedly reported that one of the girls (Furlong or S.M.) passed out in a club” (BT correspondents have yet to identify which club the women supposedly visited).&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;According to the source, “L.P.&amp;nbsp;and Blackstone helped Furlong and S.M. to the cab because the girls wanted to leave and they (the women) had missed their train” (as reported in the press).&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;According to the source, “S.M. admitted to willingly going with L.P.&amp;nbsp;and Blackstone to the hotel” so, by Japanese standards, that leaves a lot of questions about consent and what happened in the cab under the guise of the law.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;According to the source, “before Furlong and S.M. left the club – AND BEFORE THE&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;OTHER GIRL GOT REALLY DRUNK – the two of them went outside with a white guy. When the women returned they were suddenly “DRUNK” or in an intoxicated or high state.”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;According to the source,&amp;nbsp;Furlong’s death “may have&amp;nbsp;more to do with rough sex than intentional murder.”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;According to the source,&amp;nbsp;Furlong was reported to be “bleeding from her mouth when they found her.”&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;After checking online news and Japanese TV, it seems that Tokyo Police have yet to release the coroners report on Furlong. There is no confirmation her on blood content.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;According the source, “when they realized Nicola was unconscious, the police and ambulance were called. Everyone came out to see what was going on. The other girl (S.M.) knew where she was just really “out of it”.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to another source, “the US Embassy has stepped in and two men were arrested for sexual assault of Furlong’s “intoxicated” friend while the group were in a taxi. The two men are no longer in contact with the band or AI’s management.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to different source, “the other girl [reportedly S.M.] was still visibly groggy, even during the police questioning.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to the source, “it looks like the girls went to the club before the guys (allegedly L.P. and Blackstone) and had already started drinking.”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;[COMMENTARY] &lt;div&gt;And here's what I know about living in Tokyo: Hook-ups like these are pretty common. Just head over to Roppongi or Shibuya any weekend and you'll find all sorts of random dealings between mostly Japanese people and a few Non-Japanese as well. It's a big city with big city problems and big city vice.&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;Also, "groupie behavior" has been around for longer than this past week, remember? I'm pretty sure if I found myself in the company of my favorite idol and she asked me to go to a hotel with her, I wouldn't decline at all... &amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;These young ladies were studying at a college in GUNMA prefecture, located about an hour or two away by train to the northwest of Tokyo. It is a VERY rural area and these ladies were probably very excited to be out for a night on the town.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;Conversely, the young men were also probably "crusin' for chicks" after performing earlier in the day, and what's wrong with that? The taxicab antics were uncalled for in my opinion--not to mention Tokyo taxis have cameras in them by law.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;The young ladies volunteered willingly to go to the hotel with the two young men for the night, so I must invoke my "Mike Tyson/Robin Givens statute" here: &amp;nbsp;&lt;u&gt;You know damn well what is going to try to go down if you go to a hotel/bedroom/back seat/closet/secluded area with a member of the opposite sex after midnight&lt;/u&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;Remains of murdered Wexford student Nicola Furlong to be repatriated from Japan on Thursday, as rapper and dancer remain in custody. #JapanEvening Herald&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;My heart truly goes out to the families of ALL involved. This is tragic and I take it a little personal since I am also a foreigner living in Japan. We all kind of have the same set of experiences in this place, so I&amp;nbsp;empathize&amp;nbsp;completely.&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;Japan police investigating death of #nicolafurlong believe she was sexually assaulted after she was strangled. http://bit.ly/JHqxNOBlack Tokyo&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;The reality is-- it's becoming way to common here...&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;@StarrWulfe @onmugen @blacktokyo 'never in japan' right... cuz there wasnt that russian girl killed just a few weeks earlier.Mariko&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;@TokyoTwilighter @blacktokyo @onmugen exactly... or the drugged woman in Osaka a few months ago... or...J L Gatewood&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;@StarrWulfe @blacktokyo @onmugen this convo is depressingMariko&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;Agreed.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Stay tuned to this blog, and www.blacktokyo.com for the latest in this ongoing story.&lt;/div&gt;</noscript>
