Really cool read for a kid of 13 years old (let me stop, my nerd just got loose...)</span><br /></div><div><span style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;"><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: small; line-height: normal;">Anyway this guy talks about the idea that there are parallel universes.   And as much as you might wanna dismiss all of this as some sort of fiction...  this thing in norway appear.  Listen to his chat here on BBC then watch the Norway incident above one more time...  Put 2 and 2 together...  Something's rotten in Copenhagen...</span></span><br /><span style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;"><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: small; line-height: normal;"><br /></span></span><br /></div><div><object height="417" width="500"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/-rg3uNrI8tE&hl=en&fs=1" /><param name="wmode" value="window" /><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/-rg3uNrI8tE&hl=en&fs=1" allowfullscreen="true" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" wmode="window" height="417" width="500"></embed></object><br /></div><div><br />Then see what he said about 2012... <br /></div><div><br /><object height="417" width="500"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/FN9RyIa6jQE&hl=en&fs=1" /><param name="wmode" value="window" /><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/FN9RyIa6jQE&hl=en&fs=1" allowfullscreen="true" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" wmode="window" height="417" width="500"></embed></object><br /></div><div><br />Now I do remember the last time we had a magnetic storm 10 years ago...  I was working at a CBS TV station in Atlanta and our main programming downlink was out for 2 days...  we had to go back to running tapes of programming... My cellphone was out for half a day, and RIM's blackberry service was down on and off for 2 weeks...  CNN's satellite downlink was in and out as well--that was the reason they started messing with using the internet to transmit TV images from overseas...  as a BACKUP system.<br /></div><div>I'm really trying to be objective about this folks.  I am a trained journalist.  I edit a magazine.  I am from the SHOW-ME State of Missouri...  Where realness talks, and BS walks a country mile.  I have a saying that I live and die by-- I never trust what I hear the first time, only half of what I see, and ALL of what I feel and know. <br /></div><div>After seeing this...  I feel like maybe that 2012 thing could be worth preparing for...  Just a little...  Maybe just being more alert now for the next 2 years and see what's up... <br /></div><div>Please, gimme your thoughts and opinions, but no crazy rants, no in-fighting, etc...  I wanna know if I'm the only one thinking about this....<br /></div><div style="font-size: 9px;">Posted via email by J7  <br /></div>
