I managed to eat my way through Atlanta back home during my now annual summer trek back Stateside.  One of the big things I miss about living over here in Japan is the lack of food choices at times. You can only eat so much sushi, ramen, yakiniku, curry and so on... <img title="Tongue Out" src="http://jlgatewood.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/smiley-tongue-out.gif" alt="Tongue Out" border="0" />
