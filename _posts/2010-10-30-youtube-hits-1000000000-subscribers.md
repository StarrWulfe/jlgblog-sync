<blockquote><br /><h3><img class="alignleft" src="http://www.jlgatewood.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/youtube.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="100" />1 billion subscriptions and counting</h3><br />Early on (we're talking '06 here, people!), the yellow subscribe  button made its debut so the latest videos from your favorite channels  could make a beeline to your YouTube homepage/eager eyes. Today, the  button that’s been <a href="http://dailybooth.com/throwboy/6158059">immortalized as a throw cushion</a> hits an important landmark: it’s been clicked over one billion times.﻿<br /><br />--<a href="http://youtube-global.blogspot.com/2010/10/1-billion-subscriptions-and-counting.html" target="_blank">YouTube Blog</a></blockquote><br />Wow.   I remember first seeing YouTube and thinking "one day, TV, movies, and other video content will come from the net like this.  And I'll be able to watch something like <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20EO4XMBQgM">Fringe</a> alongside <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AHuiewT41EA">cats falling off televisions</a>...<br /><br />So I started uploading videos of my <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pn9ucJo4xSc">adventures in Japan</a>. Created my own <a href="http://www.youtube.com/starrwulfe/">channel</a> to house it.  And even thought I may do a live stream here and there, YouTube is the place where the WORLD watches internet video...<br /><br />Just the other day, one of my students came up to me in the hallway and said "先生のユーチューブペイージを気に入った” meaning he bookmarked my YouTube page...  Yikes. Now I gotta watch what I post for reals!!<br /><br />So why not join the young lad if you wouldn't mind...  Please subscribe to it too!
