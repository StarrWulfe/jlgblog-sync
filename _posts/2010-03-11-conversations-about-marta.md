After living in Japan again, I'm not complaining. I took the Meitetsu Mu-Sky Rapid to Centrair-- it was very nice, and I fell asleep.  I wouldn't dare try any of that here though...  <p>While riding the subway I noticed the new maps are all color coded.  Instead of saying "north-south line" or "airport line" now there's red, blue, green and yellow....  yellow-- gold?  huh?</p><p>The problem here is that the yellow--er gold line runs through an asian part of town at it's terminus.  I don't think when the map was created, anyone ever intended as a bad joke to say "hey lets call this one the yellow line since it runs through little Asia in Atlanta"  I actually had the job of redesigning MARTA's map back in 1998 when the north line (now the Red line) was extended. </p><p>I guess I find this strange now since I live in a country that's 99% one ethnic group--Japanese.  No one ever does a town hall meeting about anything concerning the other 1% of people...  which is why things like the Obama monkey TV commercial happen...<br /><object height="417" width="500"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/hInLo10I72w&hl=en&fs=1" /><param name="wmode" value="window" /><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/hInLo10I72w&hl=en&fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" height="417" wmode="window" width="500"></embed></object></p><p>I think everyone should turn their sensitivity meters down a little bit.  What if the rail line was ALREADY called the Yellow line BEFORE the Asians moved to that part of Atlanta (and I remember 15 years ago, there were none up that way...) would they have asked MARTA to change the signs?  </p><p>And before the table turning begins, I don't care if they rename the Green line to the Black line.  It does have a station that is in the projects--and the other end lies at the Martin Luther King Memorial...  Suits me just fine...  The line passes the State Capitol and CNN center too.  I already know I can go anywhere, and am NOT limited to a line drawn on a map!</p><p style="font-size: 9px;">  Posted via web from <a href="http://starrwulfe.info/conversations-about-marta">...all about starrwulfe...</a>  </p></div>
