Quich geography check- Nagoya is between Tokyo and Osaka so this makes it conveient for me to do this.  For those that dont know, i got a cheap ticket that lets me ride all Japan Rail "slow trains" (anything other than bullet train and Ltd. Express) so while it takes longer to get places, its way cheaper and actually more fun to me.  Right  now im in Fuji city and thats Mt. Fuji right out the train window. Not a bad view either...
