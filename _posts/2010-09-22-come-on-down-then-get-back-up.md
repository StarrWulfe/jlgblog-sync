Barker was taken to the hospital briefly. <br /><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob%20Barker" style="clear: right; display: block; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em; margin-top: 0pt; padding: 0px 6px; text-align: center;"><img height="320px" src="http://placeholder.apture.com/ph/360x320_WikipediaArticle/" style="border: 0px none;" title="Bob Barker" width="360px" /></a>Thursday night Bollinger said Barker was feeling better, so they  released him and he's home resting comfortably and will take it easy.   The publicist said they believe it was dehydration that caused the  problem.</blockquote></blockquote><br />Seriously, get well soon Bob. You're a well-watched piece of my childhood.
