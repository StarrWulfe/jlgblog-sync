><div><div> Just got FTTH 光インタネット (that's fiber optic internet to the English speaking boys & girls) installed.  Something that I can't even imagine having in the US in Atlanta right now.     <p>Currenty I'm pulling these speeds thru the WiFi in my apartment... TO MY IPHONE.  HA.    </p><p><img src="http://posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/starrwulfe/hFIrbsbnzyBkybnuyJyyEzatfgmAeqGghFuqHGsqzjjpIfhmuahDwpzoHnJo/media_httpiimgurcomLv_irlvo.png.scaled500.png" width="340" height="95" />     </p><p>Mind you, this is from here in Japan, to Palo Alto, California USA.   </p><p>When I was back home, I had to make do with a pokey DSL line that was on-again-off-again constantly whenever the wind blew.  I think the greatest speed I got was a paltry 1 megabit burst with about 700kbps sustained...  on a good day.  Mind you I was paying $65/month for that.  Ick... </p><p>That same amount of yen here in Japan gets me a FIBER OPTIC LINE that yields between 8-10 MEGABITS PER SECOND.   <br />To illustrate this, imagine downloading a CD full of songs in MP3 format...  about 200MB.   <br />My old connection took about 1 hr to do it.  If it didn't give up halfway.   <br />This connection did it in the time it took me to write, format, and post this blog post-- 8 minutes.  DAYUM! </p><p>So even though I'm in Japan, I'm about to be a HULU watching FOOL!  oh and I still kept my Netflix account open so I can watch streaming movies that way too...  Guess I'll watch Avatar for the 3921st time...  Holla.</p></div><p style="font-size: 9px;">  Posted via web from <a href="http://starrwulfe.info/got-some-fiber-in-my-diet">...all about starrwulfe...</a>  </p></div>
