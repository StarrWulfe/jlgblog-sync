><p><img style="float: left; border: 5px solid black;" src="http://www.jlgatewood.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/fQxn8.png" alt="Aww Snap!" width="309" height="236" />Sorry 'bout that y'all...  Earlier today, my blog ate a furball and tried to hack it back up in the form of an RSS feed loop.  Meaning the same posts were being re-read and placed into new posts and being read again, resulting in a posting loop.  If you subscribe to the blog via email, I am truely sorry for barraging your inbox over 2 hours.  It wasn't spam.</p><p>I've fixed the issue, and things should be back to normal.  </p><p> </p><p>Thanx,</p><p>J7blog Mgmt.</p>
