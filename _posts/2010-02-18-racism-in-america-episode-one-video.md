Even in Twenty-Ten.  It's a lil' less than it used to be, but sometimes its still there.  I tend to brush things aside as just sheer innocent ignorance (hey I live in Japan where I know some people have never seen a black man in person before--they have no clue what to think except what TV has told them, right?)  <br />But in America, nobody gets a pass....  We've been here for 400+ years.  We ain't goin' nowhere.  Most folks are cool...   99.8%.  I love y'all for it too.  But that other 0.2% is makin' white folks look hella bad sometimes.  Do something about them fools, yo.</p></div><p style="font-size: 9px;">  Posted via web from <a href="http://starrwulfe.info/racism-in-america-episode-one-video">...all about starrwulfe...</a>  </p></div>
