Again, I'm not into new year's resolutions-- I'm in to new year's PLANS.  Here's one for 2011-- I call myself a photographer. I should be taking pictures ALL THE TIME. So I'm gonna start taking a pic a day. Since I have my iPhone within a 1m radius about my person at all times, most of the pix I post are gonna come from there.  I have several tools at my disposal in that vein.<br /><br /><a href="http://instagr.am" target="_blank">Instagram</a>-- the great, fast-growing app for shooting, applying f/x, and posting pix everywhere. I also use <a href="http://picplz.com" target="_blank">PicPlz</a>, and was thinking about <a href="http://dailybooth.com" target="_blank">DailyBooth</a>...<br /><a href="http://posterous.com" target="_blank">Posterous</a>-- again, theres an app for that, and you've no doubt visited www.starrwulfe.info, my media blog which is posterous-powered... No? Check it out, then get your own!!<br /><br />Other shots will be handled by my crazy-cool Lumix GH1.<br /><br /><div><div><table><tr><td style="width:160px;"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-DMC-GH1K-12-1MP-Thirds-Interchangeable/dp/B001WAKSCW?tag=httpembedly-20"><img height="107px" width="160px" src="http://www.jlgatewood.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/41iZ8UAwujL._SL160_.jpg" /></a></td><td style="width:100%;"><h3><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-DMC-GH1K-12-1MP-Thirds-Interchangeable/dp/B001WAKSCW?tag=httpembedly-20">Panasonic DMC-GH1K 12.1MP Four Thirds Interchangeable Lens Camera with 1080p HD Video</a></h3><span>Product by Panasonic</span><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-DMC-GH1K-12-1MP-Thirds-Interchangeable/dp/B001WAKSCW?tag=httpembedly-20#moreAboutThisProduct">More about this product</a><hr size="1" noshade="noshade"/><table><tr><td>Price:</td><td>Too low to display</td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-DMC-GH1K-12-1MP-Thirds-Interchangeable/dp/B001WAKSCW?tag=httpembedly-20"></a></td></tr></table></div></div><br />I love this camera. No it's not a Canon 1D or some other big-ass SLR... But then again it's not a big-ass SLR! I can take great shots, shoot great video, and not lug all the weight!<br /><br />So there you have it... I am a photog, and I will be posting EVERYDAY here on JLG.j7 and wherever else you've seen me.<br /><br />I'm EVERYWHERE, remember?<br /><br /><br />P.S.-- If you catch me "slippin'" and I haven't posted a pic, kindly remind me? Chances are I took one, and just didn't upload it yet...<br /><br /><a href="http://instagr.am/p/4jTi/"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="http://www.jlgatewood.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/2db6b960dc3b42fe8b48b012b6855ab1_7.jpg" alt="" /></a><br />Taken at 新瑞橋 (Aratama-bashi, Nagoya)<br /><br />http://maps.google.com/maps?q=%E6%96%B0%E7%91%9E%E6%A9%8B+map&hl=en&ie=UTF8&hq=&hnear=Aratamabashi+Station,+Japan&ll=35.116565,136.9367&spn=0.002646,0.004635&t=h&z=18<br /><br /><a href="http://goo.gl/maps/mLe5" target="_blank">Bigger map: http://goo.gl/maps/mLe5</a>
