The condom was found in a hotel room the family had just checked into.  Why was the room not cleaned THOROUGHLY before they checked in?  <br />Not sure where the tyke found it in the room-- if it was found under the bed, I could maybe understand a little; usually the staff is given only 20 minutes to completely change a room out between guests-- who'd put something under the bed?  why would it get dirty?  However every other place should get checked. <br />My prayers go to the family.  He doesn't have the STD version, but this does mean that he won't be kissing anyone....  Does oral herpes go away, or is there a cure? Nope.  Just like the other STD version, its always there--he'll just be having breakouts from now on...  Yikes.  I hope they sue the $#¡† out of the Wyndham Hotel chain.</div><div style="font-size: 9px;">Posted via email from <a href="http://starrwulfe.info/4-year-old-contracts-herpes-after-used-condom">...all about starrwulfe...</a></div><div style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><img border="0" height="1" src="http://www.jlgatewood.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/uHUZX.jpg" width="1" /></div><div style="font-size: 9px;">   </div></div>
