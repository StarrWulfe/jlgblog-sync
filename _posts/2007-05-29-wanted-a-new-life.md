>yesterday i moved into a new apartment. up til, then i lived in my old place for 3 years, 8 months, 4 days. its the 2nd longest time i've lived in a dwelling in my life. the first time, i was 8! 2007 is being called "the year of the change" for me because so much is changing in my life--some intentional, some totally involuntary, but all very needed. i'll be 30 this year and im melancholy. mostly because i feel ill be alone still. alone in a sea of people. alone.
