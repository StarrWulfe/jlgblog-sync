Me: "well I don't really have a girlfriend right now, so let's get together and go to a movie together or something."

Her: "you seem like you have a lot of girls."

Me: "really? Where?"

Her: (pointing at picture on Facebook)   "here"

Me: "these are all my friends. But she has a boyfriend, that ones
married... Got a lotta friends."

Her: "<span style="text-decoration: underline;">we</span> can be friends then too..."

Me: "didn't I just say I got a lot of friends? I don't need no more.
Im'a holla. "
