WTF?! Ustream, Fix that!! Now everyone can see my email address! LOL... Doesn't matter, its Gmail, so spammers can bring it!</p>  <p>Obviously I staged this so I could point out what could happen with the app.  Suppose someone sent some sensitve info via text message or email and this happened?  I noticed it when i was streaming before and immediately turned notifications off, but the average user wont know to cancel their text message pop-ups without some sort of reminder; most probably are unarae it can be turned off at all!</p>  <p>So to Ustream-- make a version 1.1 that either grabs the stream from the camera or automatically turns off notices while filming.</p>  <p><img src="http://posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/starrwulfe/bwAqBmvcFjcyfdsioBuiJikmFuvyeeeoGABGwyrDIIFChCiEdDptivAjFGhq/media_httpprofileakfbcdnnetobject31057124s985411473777521jpg_fChbyDgDdrhxlbh.jpg.scaled500.jpg" width="100" height="100" /> </p>      <p style="font-size: 9px;">  Posted via email by J7  </p>
