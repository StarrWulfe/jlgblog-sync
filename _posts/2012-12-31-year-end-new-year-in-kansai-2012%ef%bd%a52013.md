I decided to come back to where it all began for me 13 years ago here in Japan-- Osaka. It's important for me right now to refocus myself and make sure I'm on the path that I chose so long ago. I must remember the reasons why I chose a life in Japan over one back home in the States along with the rewards and consequences that have resulted (and those yet to be.) 

Be that as it may, as I look out over the land I fell in love with so long ago, it's still just as clear as it was back then...

日本は永遠に好きやろな。
