I also kinda needed to anyway because I looked in my PC and through all my junk and found that the last serious pictures I took on purpose (i.e. that weren't just of me being out with friends or goofing off) were like 2 years ago!</p>

This comes from always being behind the camera working and shooting; I'm usually the photographer on these shoots, not the other way around... So enjoy, and tell me what ya think...
