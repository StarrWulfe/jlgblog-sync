<img class="alignleft" style="margin-left: 5px;margin-right: 5px" src="http://www.jlgatewood.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/steve-jobs.jpg" alt="" width="480" height="359" /> Thanks for turning around the world's greatest computer company and making software and hardware that is easy to use, fun to work with, and always innovative. <br /><br /><br /><blockquote>Letter from Steve Jobs<br />To the Apple Board of Directors and the Apple Community:<br /><br />I have always said if there ever came a day when I could no longer meet my duties and expectations as Apple’s CEO, I would be the first to let you know. Unfortunately, that day has come.<br /><br />I hereby resign as CEO of Apple. I would like to serve, if the Board sees fit, as Chairman of the Board, director and Apple employee.<br /><br />As far as my successor goes, I strongly recommend that we execute our succession plan and name Tim Cook as CEO of Apple.<br /><br />I believe Apple’s brightest and most innovative days are ahead of it. And I look forward to watching and contributing to its success in a new role. <br /><br />I have made some of the best friends of my life at Apple, and I thank you all for the many years of being able to work alongside you.<br /><br />Steve <br /></blockquote><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><blockquote></blockquote>
