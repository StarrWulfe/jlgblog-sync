<span style="font-family: courier new;">Hi. I'm from Israel. Love your blog.</span>

<span style="font-family: courier new;"> The story goes like this: I study Japanese for several years now, and I can read about 1400 kanji more or less. One day, my co-worker approaches me with his cellphone. "Can you tell me what this says?" he asks me, showing me a photo of a piece of fabric carrying the kanji </span>私変態<span style="font-family: courier new;">. I take a look, and reply "It's not grammatical, but it basically says "I'm a pervert".</span>

<span style="font-family: courier new;"> "What?!"</span>

<span style="font-family: courier new;"> "'I'm a pervert'. The first character means 'I', the other two mean 'pervert'", where did you get that from, anyway?</span>

<span style="font-family: courier new;"> "It's on my 1.5 years old daughter's shirt!"</span>

<span style="font-family: courier new;"> After LOLing for about 15 minutes straight, I kind of demanded that he get me a photo of the complete shirt so I can send it to Hanzi Smatter. And here is the shirt, complete with the cute, luckless 1.5 years old "hentai" herself.</span>

<span style="font-family: courier new;"> I mean, yes, I have seen intentionally-made "hentai" shirts around the web (and on Hanzi Smatter). Adults buy them and wear them for the laughs. But who in his right mind would put this on a toddler's shirt, and sell it in a children's clothing store rather than a joke shop? I can't imagine.</span>

<span style="font-family: courier new;"> Yes, I suppose it *could* mean "metamorphosis", but really, outside scientific contexts, it's almost always means "pervert". Or am I wrong?</span>

<span style="font-family: courier new;"> Cheers,</span>
<span style="font-family: courier new;"> Herouth</span>

Cute kid, though. The "bunny" or whatever kind of cute animal that is also on the shirt is a nice touch. We have obviously uncovered a diabolical plot to "pervert" innocent youth with inappropriate hanzi!
<div>
<div>By the way, the T-shirt would be cuter and better if it was grammatically correct, like:</div>
<div><span style="font-size: 130%;">私、変態なんです。</span>[I ... am a pervert.]</div>
<div><span style="font-size: 130%;">私、変態かも…</span>[I might be a pervert...]</div>
</div>
<div>As it is, it sounds more like Tarzan-speak: "me - pervert." You kind of expect "you - Jane" next.</div>

Actually the term "hentai" was once solely used in a technical sense by psycologists to label a personality "different and prone to sexual addictions" from that of the norm. It's only after the scandals in the '70s involving several "upstanding members of the community" got published by Japan's famous "loose-writing" (and gotta-be-some-kinda-shade-of-yellow) journalism community, did the term 変態 come to be known by the wider public-at-large.

From <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/変態">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/変態</a> --
In Japanese the word hentai is a kanji compound of 変 (hen meaning "change" "weird" or "strange") and 態 (tai meaning "attitude" or "appearance"). The term is used as a shortened form of the phrase 変態性欲 (hentai seiyoku), or "sexual perversion". In slang, 変態 (hentai) is used as an insult meaning roughly "pervert" or "weirdo".
