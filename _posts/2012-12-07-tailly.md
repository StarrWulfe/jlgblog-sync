A combination of cosplay, wearable computing, and neuroscience are mixed to create this belt which monitors your heart rate. The concept is simple; when you're excited, your heartrate natually speeds up. The heart monitor in Tailly senses this, and wags the faux furry appendage to match your level of percieved excitement. Once your heartrate returns to normal, the tail drops to it's normal motion of hanging out.
<blockquote>Tailly is a wearable wagging tail which reacts to the user’s heart rate. When you wear Tailly, you’ll radiate cuteness and happiness!</blockquote>
The developer behind the project, Shota Ishiwatari is responsible for producing another successful project, the <a href="http://jp.necomimi.com/news/index.html" target="_blank">Necomimi</a>. These are a pair of cat's ears that sense your brain activity and respond by making random movements. An American company picked up the licensing for that product and it's currently selling all around the world. He is using Kickstarter now to get this current project funded and possibly bring it to commercial production as well.

Cosplayers and Furries should run to the <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/shota/tailly-the-tail-that-wags-when-you-get-excited" target="_blank">Kickstarter</a>, <a href="http://www.facebook.com/project.tailly" target="_blank">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/ProjectTailly" target="_blank">Twitter</a> pages right now to be first in line to get their <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">hands</span> paws on this new toy when it comes to market in 2013.
