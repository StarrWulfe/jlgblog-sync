Here's the issue...  I need to find a way to get comments scattered about the web about my content put in one place; preferably in the spot it originated...<br /><br />I have a self-hosted Wordpress blog.  I also am the online editor for the web-zine version of <a href="http://www.ranmagazine.com" target="_blank">RANmagazine</a>. In both cases, I'd say there are about 6-8 posts a day on average between the two.  On my blog, it's as random as I am...  I could be ranting about US politics in one post, and in the next post, showing off a street snapshot from Nagoya, Japan, where I live.  In the case of the magazine, it's all articles from various sources.<br /><br />In both cases there's twitter accounts that get tweeted, and Facebook pages that get content liked and shared...  And of course this generates comments that turn into conversations and become just as compelling as the content that created it...<br /><br />The problem is though, there's no way I can see the total picture of the conversation, and there's no way anyone can see comments about the same post from their side of the network.<br /><br /><img class="alignright" style="margin-top: 3px; margin-bottom: 3px;" title="FB and twitter" src="http://www.jlgatewood.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/u5CUY.jpg" alt="FB and twitter" width="219" height="140" /><br /><br />For example:<br /><br />I posted a discussion on sexy "Korean girl bands vs. cute Japan girl bands" at <a title="J vs. K: Sexy vs. Cute | JLG.j7" href="http://www.jlgatewood.com/2010/11/j-vs-k-sexy-vs-cute.html/">http://tinyurl.com/2wsbbxy</a> The discussion is now two-sided; <a href="http://www.facebook.com/posts/493456990498" target="_blank">Facebook</a> and Twitter having a slightly different conversation track going on.  It would be great if I could import ALL comments across the net into wordpress somehow as it unfolds, just so everyone could see what was goin on at the source and I could moderate as well.<br /><br />Of couse what hampers some of this is Facebook's walled garden...  i.e. you can't see the conversation on Facebook without being a logged in member. There are some plugin apps like <a href="http://www.facebook.com/Wordbooker" target="_blank">Wordbooker</a> (facebook link) that pull/push comments to/from Facebook using a signed app and the Graph API though.<br /><br />The other side of course is Twitter, which is more like an SMS app for the internet. Just as text messages are sent out in no particular relation, things are tweeted. If you have a recent smartphone though, you know that SMSs to/from a certain contact within a certain timeframe get concatenated and threaded. That's all done by your phone though, not by the network. Same with twitter. Unless you're using a twitter client to thread your comments that is. Luckily there are a few services out there that will agreggate your conversations...  <a href="http://twitoaster.com/" target="_blank">Twitoaster</a> for example, groups all tweets about a URL and makes it into a threaded conversation. But it only works with a certain algorithm-- but the plugin works, and has posted twitter reactions (only conversations though) back to my comments.<br /><br />If I had the programming prowess, I'd definitely be on top of this problem, because I suspect I am not the only one here wanting a solution to this...<br /><br />Is anyone doing this yet? How are you doing it?<br /><div>See this Amp at <a href="http://amplify.com/u/erpf">http://amplify.com/u/erpf</a></div>
