OK, so I'm guilty of thinking that Japanese girls wearing sailor suit school uniforms, running along the Japanese streetscape are cute...
Whatever lolita complex claims you have against me aside, this is a catchy tune about summertime from the Nagoya branch of AKB48, called SKE48.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File%3ASke48_teamk2.jpg
<blockquote><strong>SKE48</strong> is an all-female Japanese theater/idol group produced by <a title="Yasushi Akimoto (page does not  exist)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Yasushi_Akimoto&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1">Yasushi Akimoto</a>. The audition was held during the summer and debuted in October 2008. SKE48 performs in the newly built studio in the renovated Sunshine Sakae in <a title="Nagoya" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagoya">Nagoya</a>, <a title="Aichi  Prefecture" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aichi_Prefecture">Aichi Prefecture</a>, every Saturday. The first SKE48 stage was a revival of Team A's Party ga Hajimaru yo.
Akimoto was offered the chance to start a production in Nagoya along with the renewal of the Sunshine Sakae, when he was thinking of making his "48 project" a nationwide project. He had a couple of offers even from outside of Japan, so he decided to use Nagoya as the place to move on with the project. Akimoto has said that selected members from both <a title="AKB48" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AKB48">AKB48</a> and SKE48 may release a single, rather than releasing two different singles.<sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SKE48#cite_note-0">[1]</a></sup> But they released their first single in 2009.

Here's a song by their sister group from Tokyo, AKB48...  あたしいの制服はジャマをする, or "My School Uniform is Getting in the Way"

Before you start flaming me, remember what it was like to be in high school yourself?  I was the only one of my friends with a car and not-so-strict parents, so I could hang out even on a school night...  But my friends usually couldn't, and ESPECIALLY girls I was dating, so I ended up going home early anyway...  Again Japanese teenagers are just like teens everywhere else--in a hurry to be adults. What I didn't understand then though is that becoming an adult meant more crap I gotta do...  I wish I was a damn teenager or younger again now!!

Some info about AKB48...

Unlike other idol groups in Japan, AKB48 is theater-based and have their own theater in <a title="Akihabara" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akihabara">Akihabara</a> (a district in Tokyo) where they perform once every weekday, and more than once on both Saturday and Sunday.

Some of the title songs released as a single have been made a <a title="Tie-in" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tie-in">tie-in</a> song for a television show or a television advertisement.

<span style="color: black;">AKB48 is divided into three teams: Team A, Team K and Team B.

All this aside, what are your feelings about Japan teen idol groups?  When I first moved here, there was
