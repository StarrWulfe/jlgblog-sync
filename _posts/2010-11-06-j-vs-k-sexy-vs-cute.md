I'm prolly gonna catch mad heat for this post, but whatever. It needs to be said.<br /><br />A good buddy on twitter, @TokyoDan, just turned me on to a very sexy music video he found on YouTube called <span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal; font-size: 12px;">"Chocolate Love" by Korean girl group "</span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal; font-size: 12px;">GIRLS` GENERATION (소녀시대)"</span><br />http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2NkGHkqDZk<br />It's sparking a debate now with us-- Where are the sexy Japanese girls in music? And before you start accusing me of being sexist or something, I'm a GUY...  I'm SUPPOSED to like SEXY girls. It's called ATTRACTION.<br /><br />Now Japanese girls, they got that cute thing down...  By cute, I mean, the cute as a lil' rabbit on Easter Sunday cute. You'll see all kinds of girls dressing like they're 8,9,10 years old in poofy, frilly dresses, pastel colors, or sometimes even wearing those animal pajamas with the bunny ears on the hood...  But the chick will be like 27 years old or something... Uhh yeah, there's something wrong with that...  Where does it come from? Well look at a music video--unlike American artists and apparently Korean ones too, most J-girl artists are more cute here than sexy...  Which is fine; there's a time and place after all...  But I'm from the USA, home of Beyonce, Janet Jackson, and Kelly Price...  All of whom can be as cute as a 10 year-old in her sunday best in one scene, and be damn near scandalous in the next...  Anyway, here's the resultant twitter conversation...<br /><br />http://twitter.com/StarrWulfe/status/492433179676672<br />http://twitter.com/TokyoDan/status/494312789905408<br /><br />We need to go back to olden times then my friend!!<br /><br />http://twitter.com/sabai_sabai/status/495693026299904<br /><br />Here's some more video for ya then, to give your eyes a proper challenge!<br /><br /><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_gfD3nvh-8">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_gfD3nvh-8</a><br /><p><span><a href="http://static.youku.com/v1.0.0131/v/swf/qplayer.swf?VideoIDS=XMjA5NjUzNzI4&embedid=-&showAd=0">http://v.youku.com/v_show/id_XMjA5NjUzNzI4.html</a></span></p><br /><p></p>
