Swap contact info with other Japanese smartphones using this app<br /><br />If you have a made-in-Japan android phone, then you likely have a Felica chip inside. Thats the Sony made NFC chip that allows your phone to become a train pass or store e-money on it.  You can use this app to beam your contact info to another phone by tapping it. They dont have to have anything open either; its automatic!<br /><br />So Whats taking so long for my fellow americans to figure out how to use NFC in a cellphone? We have been able to do this with featurephones even...  jeez. Come to Japan, and Ill show ya how we do it.<br /><br /><a href="https://market.android.com/details?id=com.ixa.android.felica">https://market.android.com/details?id=com.ixa.android.felica</a>
