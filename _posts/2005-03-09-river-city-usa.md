This is my birthplace. Some famous people have been here... [Lewis & Clark](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_and_Clark_Expedition "Lewis and Clark Expedition"), [Redd Foxx](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0289359/ "Redd Foxx"), [Nelly](http://www.rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/nelly "Nelly"), [Samuel Clemens](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Twain "Mark Twain") (aka Mark Twain)... There is a place there where there are plaques on the sidewalk like the Hollywood walk of fame. You get a star if you are a "hometown son (or daughter) done good." I will have one there somehow... Although I have lived half my life outside of STL, it is still my hometown, and for all its faults one thing is true... Even if the rest of the world doesn't like me, I can always go home.
