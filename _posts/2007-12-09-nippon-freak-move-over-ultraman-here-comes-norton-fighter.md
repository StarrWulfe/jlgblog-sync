But what's not to love about a place where they use "tokusatsu" to advertise for of all things, Norton Antivirus!"<br /><br />Tokusatsu is a genre of programs on Japanese TV that are like live action "giant robo" hero shows.  It usually involves several humans with secret alter-egos that form some sort of color-coded team to get the job done.  Ultraman is a long-running series in Japan for example, and here in the US, we have the Power Rangers.<br /><br />Well imagine my surprise to check out Gizmodo one day and find Norton doing an early 80's throwback tribute to those shows in Japan as a good parody and oh yeah, to move their software.  I think I just may switch my anti-virus now, especially if the Akihabara Otaku Maid Princess is thrown in...  NORTON PUNCH!!<br /><br /><object height="355" width="425"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/qXWGDS3hoNM&rel=1&border=0"></param><param name="wmode" value="transparent"><embed caption="Part Two" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/qXWGDS3hoNM&rel=1&border=0" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" height="355" width="425"></embed></param></object>
