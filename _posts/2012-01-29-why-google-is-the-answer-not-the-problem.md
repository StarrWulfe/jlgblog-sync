Why Google+ is the answer, not the problem<br /><br />I had a heated discussion with a fellow technophile buddy of mine Wednesday. He said Google&#039;s "Search + Your World" is just an attempt at trying to monopolize and brand the web, Google-style. I told him, Facebook already started that war. <br />How many times have you encountered a company&#039;s ad campaign that made you go on Facebook and "like" something BEFORE you got the information? How many times have you been told "We&#039;re on Facebook, go there to get the latest info"? Twitter&#039;s no better either. Here in Japan, there are big department stores that only give out their sale information via Twitter--but at least it&#039;s somewhat indexable by GOOG and Bing.<br /><br />I&#039;m tired of having to sign into Facebook BEFORE I do something and someone else&#039;s site. And I just wanna learn about your product or service by looking at your website, so why the hell do I need to LIKE it on Facebook first?<br /><br />The answer is because Facebook is <b>EASIER</b> for PR people to use to collect <i>VALUABLE DATA</i> about the people who are learning about their products and services... Even 5 years ago when I did PR and Online Client Relations for a large insurance company, we basically had to set up our own site, then install software to track users and do analytics. If we needed more "intrensic" data, like age/sex/email address/etc, then we had to post a form, along with legalese-laded disclamer, and understand less than 5% of our traffic is going to tell us this stuff. Facebook changed all that, because <b>you&#039;ve already filled that form out when you first logged on</b> years ago, and you&#039;re <i>continually adding to that body of info <b>everytime</b></i> you post about your school, job, family, and so on--- and those friends? We can tell about who you are by the company you keep in real life, so <i>of course</i> the same rule applies online. Also realize even the little stuff like the times of day you access Facebook, how frequently you access, how you interact (PC/mobile/etc) and your actual physical location is being recorded too...  Now do you understand how Facebook makes money? <i>They sell that info to the companies that have also made a presence on Facebook as well.</i> Of course if you read the disclamer <b>before</b> you signed up to Facebook (and any other social network) then you&#039;d know that. <br /><br />Ok, so how is Google Plus going to be the savior of the interwebs in a post Facebook/Twitter age, when G+ <i>looks and acts like both those two?</i>  Because just like anything else in Google&#039;s domain, it&#039;s <b><i>OPEN</i></b>. <br />Anytime you want to check any of the data that is used to track you around Google&#039;s part of the web, you can by going to your account dashboard. From there you can delete parts or all the info, or even download ALL YOUR content created in  Google and shut your account down. <br /><br />Remember, only Google has this to say in their Terms Of Service agreement before you sign up:<br />"Some of our Services allow you to submit content. You retain ownership of any intellectual property rights that you hold in that content. In short, what belongs to you stays yours." <br /><br />Read the proceeding story below and let me know if you agree/disagree with my stance on this issue, and more importantly, how you&#039;d change things if you were in charge of the internets.<br /><br /><a href="http://googlesystem.blogspot.com/2012/01/google-and-post-web-google.html">Google+ and the Post-Web Google</a><br /><br /><img src="http://images0-focus-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?container=focus&gadget=a&resize_h=100&url=http%3A%2F%2F2.bp.blogspot.com%2F-DbhX5cTUTx8%2FTyM_8QdvTeI%2FAAAAAAABEF8%2FcZZ4KkkEBt8%2Fs640%2Fsamsung-ad-facebook-link.jpg" class="alignleft" />I&#039;ve noticed an increasing number of ads that no longer send people to the company&#039;s sites. Instead, the ads only include a link to the official Facebook page. Sites suddenly look outdated, no...
