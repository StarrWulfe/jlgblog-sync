>Mr Obama, I am proud to have helped to deliver the great state of Georgia!  I voted early last week in the Advanced Voting Polling center; its a good thing too because I'm here in St Louis tending to family business...  Speaking of which, I got my grandparents to the polls today in St Louis County-- Both staunchly behind Obama.  So I think I really voted 3 times!!  Yeah!<br /><br />BTW, What in the blue hell was Rep. John Lewis thinking?  Joseph Lowery had it right when he basically said that he was out of his mind not supporting Obama...  I think Mr Lewis had some favor he owed the Clintons...  But that's just me...
