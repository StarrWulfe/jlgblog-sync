There are about another 16 more school days left, but its mostly tests or studying for tests, and for the 3rd year students, a time to make memories since they'll be going to high school in April.  (Schools in Japan run April to March BTW, not August/September to May/June like back home in the USA.)<br /><br />Because of this, I had 2 farewell speeches to give at the 2 different schools I taught at; I won't be at these schools again next school year, they'll put me somewhere else. Here are the pictures from this final week. I may not remember all their names, but I'll never forget their faces and voices.<br /><br />Most of them said "Jason sensei wa sugoi impact na. wasuraranai yo!" Means, I made a major impact on their lives they'll never forget. Neither will I.</div><div><a href="http://www.facebook.com/ext/share.php?sid=129952305453&h=tuJF3&u=73qGb" title="http://www.flickr.com/photos/starrwulfe/sets/72157613740069692/" target="_blank"></a><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/starrwulfe/sets/72157613740069692/">Click here to view the pictures...</a><br /></div><div><br /></div>
