I mean it is MY site after all ;) When it comes to the legalization of marijuana, well everyone who has ever known me should know I'm <span style="text-decoration: underline;">for</span> it.  Actually, being a card-carrying Libertarian back in the States, I'm for the legalization of a lot of things-- but I'll save that discussion for another time...<br /><a name='more'></a><br />Anyway my buddy <a href="http://www.facebook.com/ghostofmatsubara">Tom Fallon</a> posted on this very subject tonight, and it has folks talking...  Check it out-- and feel free to post your own thoughts please.<br /><blockquote><a href="http://www.facebook.com/ghostofmatsubara">Tom Fallon</a> I haven't smoked in over 6 years, but I still think that the criminalization of marijuana is hypocritical and unjust. It's really interesting to read the history of the marijuana laws. They're based on racism, yellow journalism, and corporate greed. What's<br />worse is that American colonialism forced marijuana prohibition all over the world.<br /><br />Sam Coffman a japanese guy told me the other day that ganja was a popular, recreational herb here before puritanical/hypocritical whitey showed up colonizing and banned it.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.facebook.com/ghostofmatsubara" target="_blank"> Tom Fallon</a> It wasn't illegal until the American occupation under MacArthur.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.facebook.com/ghostofmatsubara" target="_blank"> Tom Fallon</a> Furthermore, it wasn't enforced until the 1960s.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.facebook.com/natesama" target="_blank"> Nathan Raymond</a> it makes sense that a country with a religion such as shinto that says that things natural have a spirit that is to be worshiped would love Ganja..... but when Japanese lost ww2 macArthur banned it. Dick... But the old people of this country used to grow it...so they know the deal..... lots more uses than getting high..... hemp is good shit!!! But all the ceremonies here where they use the bamboo or even now Ive seent paper made tree shrubs..... used to use ganja.... the true sacriment!<br /><br /><a href="http://www.facebook.com/ghostofmatsubara"> Tom Fallon</a> Nate is telling the truth! The Ise Shrine still hold religious ceremonies that use Ganja. They're Taima ceremonies.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=654367350"> Sam Coffman</a> i didn't know that about ise-jingu. i live in mie, so all my students go there regularly. looking on the bright side = sounds like an easy lesson topic to me.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.facebook.com/ghostofmatsubara" target="_blank"> Tom Fallon</a> Sam, check out #3 of this link. http://japanhemp.org/en/shinto.htm</blockquote><br />So what do <span style="text-decoration: underline;">you</span> think?  Should weed be banned, or is it OK to be classified like alcohol and tobacco?
