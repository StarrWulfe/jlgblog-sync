But they danced all night long.  on and on and on...  i thought they'd give up.  I thought I'd give up.  Each song was 45 minutes long...  at least...  but they kept going.  I kept going.  I wanted to stop, but my legs kept moving.  I wasn't in my body...  I cared nothing about my muscles tightening.  Nothing about the cramp building up in my side, or the spasms in my back...  I wasn't feeling pain, because I was in a world where pain simply didn't exist.  I was bathed in a sea of rhythm and chanting.  I was in a singular consciousness that had succumbed to the will of Fela.  His music had ensnared the musicians long enough to make mere suburban-looking boys play the music of the depressed, oppressed, and obsessed.  I had to be older than all of them.  But once the music was going, age was lost in the ethereal singularity.  I want to get lost again. </p>
