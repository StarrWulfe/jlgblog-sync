><p><br />One of my friends on Facebook asked me a question:</p><p><ins>If you were to write a book, what would it be called and who would you dedicate it to?</ins></p><p>to which I posted the following reply:</p><p><img style="float: right;" src="http://deco-00.slide.com/r/1/363/dl/N2yaSQW26z9AX1fbegGR0e25qCjiF3QC/thumbnail" /><ins>it would be called, <cite>"100 Creative Ways to Kiss My Ass"</cite> and I'd dedicate<br />it to all the haters, posers, flakes, and dumbasses I've encountered in<br />my life.<br />And the cover would have this picture on it... Yeah!</ins></p><p>And yeah, I STILL love this picture of me...Â  It is definitely a reflection of my mood right now...</p>
