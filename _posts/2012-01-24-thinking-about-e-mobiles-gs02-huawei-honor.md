Just want everyone to know that this phone is one of the only phones sold UNLOCKED in Japan and is available on Emobile as the GS02. Unlocked meaning when I travel, I can take out the Emobile SIM card and stick a pre-paid T-mobile (or whatever company you want) card in and keep rolling.<br /><br />The big deal with this phone is that Emobile lets you have UNLIMITED data for a low price, and they keep Android's native hotspot app that lets us tether up to 5 devices at once for ∞GB/mo. and it is NOT THROTTLED.  Combine that with a talk plan that gives you 300 10 minute outgoing phone calls for ¥1595/mo (Incoming is free), and it beats my Softbank plan's pants off...<br /><br />So while this may not be a Moto RAZR or Nexus S, it'll let me get my wi-fi camera's pictures to my tablet so I can send work on the road. Awesome.<br /><br /> <br /><ul><br />	<li><img src="http://s2.googleusercontent.com/s2/favicons?domain=www.engadget.com" alt="jiffy-icon" width="16" height="16" /></li><br />	<li>Source: <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2012/01/21/huawei-honor-review/">Engadget</a></li><br /></ul><br /><div><br /><br /><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2012/01/21/huawei-honor-review/"><img class="embedlyThumbnail" src="http://www.jlgatewood.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/dsc09423-1327037261.jpg" alt="" width="100" /></a><br /><blockquote><br /><p>Based on its laundry list of specs, the Honor isn't a high-end handset compared to some of its LTE and dual-core competitors. And yet, it's still the best device Huawei's offered to date, and it's clear the company's upcoming phones are only going to get better. So we're really eyeing the Honor as a step closer to the OEM finally realizing its ultimate goal. Does it live up to its name? Can the Honor play with the big boys, or is it nothing more than just an outward indication of the company's future? Read on to find out.</p><br /></blockquote><br /><p>Read more at: <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2012/01/21/huawei-honor-review/">www.engadget.com</a></p><br /><br /><p><br /><div><br /><div><img src="http://www.jlgatewood.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/gs02_feature041.jpg" class="thumb embedly-thumbnail-small" /><a href="http://emobile.jp/products/hw/gs02/index.html">GS02 | イー・モバイル</a>Android 2.3搭載。<br /><div></div><br /><span style="float:right"><a target="_blank" href="http://embed.ly?src=anywhere" title="Powered by Embedly"><img src="http://www.jlgatewood.com//static.embed.ly/images/logos/embedly-powered-small-light.png" alt="Embedly Powered" /></a></span><br /><div><span>via </span><a href="http://emobile.jp/" target="_blank">Emobile</a></div><br /><div></div><br /></div><br /></div><br /></p></div>
