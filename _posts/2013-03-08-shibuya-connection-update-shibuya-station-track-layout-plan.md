<em>Here's another one of my posts from <a href="http://www.skyscrapercity.com/showthread.php?p=99629160#post99629160">Skyscraper City's Japan Urban Transport Forum</a> about the upcoming Toyoko/Fukutoshin lines being connected. ...This one also kinda shows how much I notice things I'm interested in; I probably know more about this project than the actual people working on it!  Only 8 more days to go--Enjoy!</em>

I found a really good track layout map on a blog called <a href="http://takuya870625.blog43.fc2.com/" target="_blank">Reports from the Future</a> posted a few days ago <a href="http://takuya870625.blog43.fc2.com/blog-entry-1239.html#more" target="_blank">located here</a>; it's the most detailed yet, and pretty much lines up what I've been noticing going on around me whenever I'm down there myself.

I've gone ahead and translated everything I could on the diagram into English, but I forgot one thing... Going left = towards Shinjuku 3-chome/Ikebukuro; going right = towards Yokohama/Motomachi-Chukagai.

1. I said before that the middle platforms looked to be shorter than the outside ones. That was before they knocked the temporary wall down and revealed another 50 meters of platform! After setting up the platform doors, and placing the signals, we can see that the entire platform space will shift 50 meters toward Yokohama, along with a new set of stairs heading up to the B4 concourse, which also isn't open yet.

2. The middle tracks (4 &amp; 5) will be set up with Tokyu specific signals and controls leading us to believe that they will be the tracks allowing for "short-trip" services--the trips that will start and end at <a class="zem_slink" title="Shibuya Station" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=35.658514,139.70133&amp;spn=0.01,0.01&amp;q=35.658514,139.70133 (Shibuya%20Station)&amp;t=h" rel="geolocation" target="_blank">Shibuya station</a> and not traverse the <a class="zem_slink" title="Tokyo Metro Fukutoshin Line" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo_Metro_Fukutoshin_Line" rel="wikipedia" target="_blank">Fukutoshin line</a>. Since the platform doors can be operated manually here by the conductors, perhaps <a target="_blank">9000 series trains</a> will be used for these trips? They don't have the necessary ATO/ATSC equipment for one-man operation in the subway installed like the other, newer train sets, but the door placement and car length is no problem for the platform doors here. A similar arrangement is in place with the <a class="zem_slink" title="Tōkyū Ōimachi Line" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T%C5%8Dky%C5%AB_%C5%8Cimachi_Line" rel="wikipedia" target="_blank">Tokyu Oimachi line</a> at <a class="zem_slink" title="Ōimachi Station" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=35.606545,139.734657&amp;spn=0.01,0.01&amp;q=35.606545,139.734657 (%C5%8Cimachi%20Station)&amp;t=h" rel="geolocation" target="_blank">Oimachi station</a> using 9000, 8000, and 7000 series cars now. (<strong>EDIT</strong>: Nope... The Tokyu 9000 series are off the <a class="zem_slink" title="Tōkyū Tōyoko Line" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T%C5%8Dky%C5%AB_T%C5%8Dyoko_Line" rel="wikipedia" target="_blank">Toyoko line</a> after 13 March.)

3. With this arrangement, there would be no need to have a "short tripper" train alight its passengers at one platform, then move ahead to the crossover beyond to switch tracks, then pick up passengers at the opposite platform. Of course passengers would need to be wary of what platform their train is on; Tracks 3 &amp; 4 are heading to Yokohama, but there may be a train on track 5 leaving outbound earlier; most times that track is used for trains inbound along with track 6.

4. This also solves the big problem with the "Shuttle Operation" issue. This is the term given whenever there is a problem or special condition that prevents the normal interlining operations to happen. It's normal that this happens in the first and last few trips of the day to get trains in and out of the system, but also happens whenever there is an accident as well. Recently there was a substation issue with the Tokyo Metro lines at Wako-shi and trains could not run past Chikatetsu-Narimasu, nor could trains enter the tunnel after interlining on the Tojo line.

Yurakucho line trains ran the entire route up to Chikatetsu-Narimasu. Fukutoshin trains ran their route and ended at <a class="zem_slink" title="Kotake-mukaihara Station" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=35.743808,139.678566&amp;spn=0.01,0.01&amp;q=35.743808,139.678566 (Kotake-mukaihara%20Station)&amp;t=h" rel="geolocation" target="_blank">Kotake-Mukaihara</a>. All <a class="zem_slink" title="Tōbu Tōjō Line" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T%C5%8Dbu_T%C5%8Dj%C5%8D_Line" rel="wikipedia" target="_blank">Tobu Tojo line</a> trains that were supposed to run into the tunnel, became locals bound for Tobu-Ikebukuro, and passengers were told to either change at Narimasu or Ikebukuro for free. <a class="zem_slink" title="Seibu Yūrakuchō Line" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seibu_Y%C5%ABrakuch%C5%8D_Line" rel="wikipedia" target="_blank">Seibu Yurakucho line</a> trains ran as local only shuttles between Kotake-Mukaihara and <a class="zem_slink" title="Nerima Station" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=35.737778,139.653568&amp;spn=0.01,0.01&amp;q=35.737778,139.653568 (Nerima%20Station)&amp;t=h" rel="geolocation" target="_blank">Nerima station</a>--just 3 stations. Had the Toyoko line been involved, I'm sure all operations would have stopped and started at Shibuya station.
