[gallery link="file"]<br /><br />OK... <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myspace">MySpace</a> is undergoing a serious makeover right now.  Facebook basically rolled up and took over the once mighty social website's thunder...  No one can really say WHY Facebook became more popular than MySpace in one word...  I personally got pissed every time I'd look at someone's page and have to wait 5 minutes while all the CRAP on their page loaded. That's if it didn't crash my browser.<br /><br />Anyway, what we do know is that MySpace (owned by big-ass media conglomerate <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News%20Corporation">News Corp</a>, home of the Fox TV network) is wanting back into that sweet sweet SNS pie-in-the-sky. So they're gonna re-invent themselves into a one-stop-internet-entertainment-shop. And it seems they're using FACEBOOK to let us know about it...<br /><br /><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhXCF5yaWJQ#t=10">Heavens to Mergatroid!</a>
