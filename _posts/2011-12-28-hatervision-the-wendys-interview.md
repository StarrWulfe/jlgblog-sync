We got to check out the grand reopening of the first store here in Omotesando, Tokyo (near Harujuku) yesterday... It was a cold, blustery day to stand in line for 2 hours but we got to talk to one of the chief officials, Darrell Van Ligten, international division president from Wendy's HQ in Atlanta! He came out to greet us and explained their plans for Japan and the new menu to us!<br /><br />So check it out, and if you're here in Japan, come to Tokyo and get your eat on!
