I love it when people from outside Japan try and make sense of what people here are doing on the internet, buying habits, cultural traits...  They don't have a clue what's going on, which is why I'm constantly <a href="http://streetsidemedia.com" target="_blank">advertising my services</a> here in Japan.  You can't take the pulse of Japan: The Internet without being here because people use the internet differently than we use it at home in the States.<br /><br />First though, read the article from RCR wireless...<a name='more'></a><br /><blockquote>While internet users worldwide are now proudly boasting a growing online contacts list made up of people they know, people they used to know, people they can’t remember how they know, people they would rather not know (but can’t say NO to), and people who they want to know, a recent study has revealed that Japan just doesn’t want to know.<br /><br />TNS, a large market research company, took a look at online antics across the globe, studying 50,000 surfers in 46 countries.  It found that when it comes to social networking, Japanese people are keeping their online profiles close to their chests and their ‘friends’  list reserved only for their friends, which on average is reportedly around 29 on sites such as facebook and Twitter.<br /><br />So what has happened? In a country where people live online why have the biggest social networking sites failed to work their magical powers? Is Japan just too sexy to be social? Or is there another explanation?<br /><br />Speculative reasons for such a poor show on these very popular sites fit nicely in to the category of ‘cultural differences’.<br /><br />According to some it is the instinctive need for privacy that discourages the Japanese from turning a molehill of vaguely known people into a mysterious contact mountain.<br /><br />At first glance this is a very admirable quality and it almost, almost makes us westerners take a good look inwards at our loose and unrestrained online behaviour and do some ‘friend cleansing.’<br /><br />But then we realise that where in the West we may have 850 friends (who we know, love dearly and will be coming round for Christmas lunch) in Japan they have affiliated themselves to a home-grown social networking site, Mixi, with more than 25 million users which does not require you to use your real name.<br /><br />In the name of privacy, this is great, but in the West a ‘face off’ social networking site is obviously much less appealing.<br /><br />The statistics are interesting however, with Japan coming in third after China and the US for having the highest internet usage in the world, the relatively low figures of users on these social networking sites should be a concern only for the networking sites themselves.<br /><br />For companies or networking sites that want to have an impact worldwide, it goes without saying that they have to learn to tailor their procedures and systems to be appealing to all, taking into account different cultures and needs.<br /><br />Another function of the popular Mixi site is that all users are able to track those who have been looking at their profile. This seems to be a selling point for our friends on the other side of the world and if Facebook want to entice more customers to its virtual door, applying this function for Japanese users could be an option.<br /><br />So whilst some ask how long it will take for Japan to reach the same level of usage on the social/virtual front, it might well be more of a question of how long it will take for social networking sites to appeal to all by transcending cultural boundaries.<br /><br />via <a href="http://unplugged.rcrwireless.com/index.php/20101123/social/5374/facebook-and-twitter-not-making-many-friends-in-japan/comment-page-1/#comment-17985">Facebook and Twitter not making many friends in Japan | RCR Unplugged</a>.</blockquote><br />Now my opinion:<br /><div style="float: left;"><a href="http://view.picapp.com/pictures.photo/entertainment/businessman-looks-his/image/9263885?term=mobile+japan" target="_blank"><img class="alignleft" style="margin-top: 4px; margin-bottom: 4px; margin-left: 3px; margin-right: 3px;" title="A businessman looks at his mobile phone at an office building in Tokyo" onmousedown="return false;" src="http://view3.picapp.com/pictures.photo/image/9263885/businessman-looks-his/businessman-looks-his.jpg?size=380&imageId=9263885" border="0" alt="A businessman looks at his mobile phone at an office building in Tokyo July 1, 2010. Japanese business confidence was at its best in two years in the three months to June and big firms revised up capital spending plans, a Bank of Japan survey showed on Thursday, in a sign the export-driven economic recovery is taking hold. REUTERS/Yuriko Nakao (JAPAN - Tags: EMPLOYMENT BUSINESS)" width="266" height="386" align="left" /></a></div><br /><p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.571em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Twitter was actually one of the most searched for words in Japan for 2010 according to Yahoo.co.jp/Softbank. Remember, most people here get on the net through their KEITAIS (mobiles) and earlier this year, DoCoMo, Softbank, and AU placed Twitter on their home decks of their feature phones… As a result there’s been 500% growth here in twitter accounts originating from Japan. As an Internet professional here in Japan, I’ve also noticed the referral rate from Twitter has climbed to #2 in my rankings. I tweet out links to everything we post on <a style="text-decoration: underline; color: #2361a1; cursor: pointer; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.ranmagazine.com/">http://www.RANmagazine.com</a> and some of the other sites I manage–both in English and Japanese.</p><br /><p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.571em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Facebook got into the game late over here, but in August totally revamped the Japanese side of their house by redoing the whole interface in Japanese, and making use of QR codes for cellphones here to autologon to their accounts. I’ve also noticed as a result of this, a ton of my Japanese friends that are on 2chan and Mixi, also set up Facebook accounts. Facebook also opened an office in Tokyo, and are set to blitz Japan in 2011 with campaigns…</p><br /><p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.571em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">BTW the number one social network here is no longer Mixi… it’s GREE, a mobile gaming network that leverages free and cheap games that can be played on most mobiles here in Japan.</p><br /><p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.571em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">I've said it time and time again...  The most used interface for accessing the internet in Japan is via MOBILE. Cellphones and now smartphones are how the average Japanese gets on the net 70% of the time.  If you cannot engage that into your plan to get Japanese eyes on your website, don't bother dealing with Japan!  Also remember, Japan's number one cellphone right now is the iPhone...  But Android powered sets are closing in too...  Again, make your content viewable on these screens, be it via an app or mobilized somehow-- and you got it made.</p><br /><p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.571em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Remember if you need help with that, I'm already here in Japan, and I am oh-so-<a href="http://www.jlgatewood.com/about-j7/jlg-resume-public/">available</a> for consultation!</p>
