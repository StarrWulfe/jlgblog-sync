In Japan, most transportation companies use some variation of Sony's Felica NFC standard for use as a transit pass and stored "e-money", but up until now, the transit companies couldn't make it so someone using a Tokyo area issued "SUICA" (JR-East) could ride the subway in Nagoya or Osaka using the money stored on that card.

This also resulted in annoyances for those that live in border areas like Mie prefecture where one would need two different cards to complete their commutes.

Now the 10 largest transport agencies have gotten together and formed the "IC Alliance" and you're able to just keep one card in your wallet (or if your mobile phone has a IC chip, download the SUICA app) and tap, tap, tap your way across Japan without having to stop at the ticket vending machines (TVM) to buy a ticket.

Recharging and using a <a class="zem_slink" title="Suica" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suica" rel="wikipedia" target="_blank">Suica card</a> (issued by JR-East) at Miyoshigaoka Station on the Meitetsu Toyota Line in Miyoshi City, Aichi Prefecture (Nagoya area, normally using the MANACA <a class="zem_slink" title="Smart card" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_card" rel="wikipedia" target="_blank">IC card</a> system). The icon on the TVM screen is still <em>manaca</em>…

Here is another example from the Kansai region using Mobile Suica (i.e., a <a class="zem_slink" title="FeliCa" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FeliCa" rel="wikipedia" target="_blank">FeliCa</a>-equipped mobile phone registered with the Suica system, that until yesterday wouldn't work there.)  These systems all use the PiTaPa system, so you can generally only use either a PiTaPa card or JR West’s ICOCA card. Now you can use Suica or any of the other seven cards.

Boarding at Yamashina Station (Yamashina Ward, Kyōto City, Kyōto Prefecture) and exiting at Sanjō Keihan Station (Higashiyama Ward, Kyōto City, Kyōto Prefecture)on the Kyōto Municipal Subway Tōzai Line:

This new interoperability will be especially handy for all the visitors in Kyoto especially tourists; most vistors to Japan usually land in the Tokyo area and head to Kyoto and other parts via the Shinkansen high-speed train system. However once in Kyoto, many attractions are better served by the extensive bus network which now will also take all 10 cards.

Then there's the very important and well used e-money aspect of this. Many retailers and almost all convenience stores, vending machines, and supermarkets take one of these IC cards as payment, depending on the region.
For example, now instead of having to find an ATM and get cash out to get a coffee or a bowl or ramen at a station in Shizuoka which only took JR Tokai's TOICA card, you can use a PASMO card issued for use in Yokohama. Or better yet, use the Mobile SUICA app with your mobile phone. This is especially good because it draws the money directly from a bank account automatically.
