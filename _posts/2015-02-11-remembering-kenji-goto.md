I am a <a class="zem_slink" title="Journalist" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journalist" target="_blank" rel="wikipedia">journalist</a>. My prime directives are to inform the uninformed, give voice to the voiceless and expose the light of truth to the darkest and ignorant corners of the world.

Its really hard living up to that ideal these days when there are top <a class="zem_slink" title="News presenter" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_presenter" target="_blank" rel="wikipedia">news anchors</a> "misspeaking on the air", and networks making it their job to spew out <a class="zem_slink" title="Half-truth" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-truth" target="_blank" rel="wikipedia">half truths</a> and spread paranoia instead of facts.

Its hard out here for an honest journalist to stay true to the craft and tell it like it is, because we're being told that we should first concern ourselves with <a class="zem_slink" title="Search engine optimization" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization" target="_blank" rel="wikipedia">SEO</a>, ad impressions, sponsorship deals, multi year exclusive contracts, <a class="zem_slink" title="Nielsen ratings" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nielsen_ratings" target="_blank" rel="wikipedia">Nielsen ratings</a>, and pandering to some agenda, politics and corporate strategies.

Because maybe that's the only way to get ahead, move up the ladder and get some serious money out of the profession.

I tend to disagree. What anyone and everyone in the news industry should be doing above all else is telling the truth in the stories that we file and nothing more and nothing less...

Some things in life are worth way more than pieces of long paper with a short future. Because sometimes, life is even shorter---and unfortunately we don't know when it'll be over.

I never got to meet Kenji Goto. However I was able to meet a lot of people who worked with him in the past and who were friends with him in the present. They told me that if I ever wanted to meet someone in my lifetime and in my area who is the personification of what a journalist should be then I ought to talk to him. Mr. Goto, I never got the chance to meet you in person, but I'm awfully glad that I'm getting to work on a project that you agreed with and we will try to keep your vision alive to bring a voice to the people without voice and the light of truth to the dark corners of the world.
