From the "Ain't That A ß¡†¢#" files:<br /><blockquote>Domino’s Pizza in Japan will be hiring one person for their 25th year anniversary, at an hourly wage of ￥2.5 million (~$30,000 USD).<br /><br />On November 10th, they revealed on their official site, “<em>It will be an hour job in December.  Please celebrate the 25th anniversary for Domino’s Pizza Japan, and let’s make Japan full of vigor</em>.”<br /><br />Anybody who lives in Japan can qualify as long as you are over 18 years old, and if you are fine with making an appearance on media devices.  The lucky person will be chosen through an interview process, where the interviewers will be 4 scary ladies (Shimizu Michiko, Shinsan Nameko, Iwai Shimako, and Mitsuura Yasuko).<br /><br />For more info, check <a href="http://www.250man.jp/" target="_blank">Domino’s Pizza Japan’s Official site</a>.</blockquote><br />Cool... But I thought it was a hoax when it trended for a minute in my Twitter account...  DAMN.  And it says ANYONE living legally in Japan.  Meaning my @$$ could've at least sent something in...  The due date is TODAY and it has to be in TOKYO by 5pm tonight...<br /><br />...wonder if <a href="http://www.kuronekoyamato.co.jp/" target="_blank">KuroNeko</a> can help a brotha out...<br /><p style="text-align: center;"></p>
