>I used to dream about growing up and being an adult.  Now I think about being a kid again.  When I have children, I will make it a point not to forget what pressures kids have.  Although these may not mean much to any adult now, the pressure of fitting in, getting along with parents, sitting at the "cool" table, and trying to talk to some cute girl/boy are real ordeals for kids.  I promise to keep this in mind when my children get to this stage.  A good parent always listens twice; hear what's said, and more importantly what is not said.  A good parent speaks once; preach one singular rule, and don't stray.  Most imortant though- a good parent always loves as much as possible.
