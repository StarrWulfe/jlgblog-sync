This boy in the picture is the reason I wish I was still a kid at times.  Children everywhere can seem to find the real unfiltered beauty in life.  </p><p>This was an act that I'm still not sure who created-- Some weird-beard from Saudi Arabia and Al Queda, or our own CIA/Illuminati...  Who knows.  </p><p>All I know is there is STILL a hole in the ground, where my PATH station used to be, the view from Newport Mall and my house in Jersey City, NJ as a kid is STILL gone, and nothing but accusations, and finger-pointing.  Meanwhile life elsewhere has gone on. </p><p>People, open your eyes and look around.  Religion means squat when it comes to these things.  Follow the money, and you'll turn up culprits every time.  </p><p>Like I have been saying these past 9 years-- WAKE UP.  </p><p>BTW, thank GOD that wacko in Florida decided NOT to burn Korans...  Guess he found out "Freedom of Speech" also means "Freedom To Get Your Ass Whooped"</p><p style="font-size: 9px;">  Posted via email from <a href="http://starrwulfe.info/condolences-to-everyone-who-suffered-during-9">...all about starrwulfe...</a>  </p></div>
