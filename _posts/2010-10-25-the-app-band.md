It seems there's a app for everything on iOS now right? Anyone who knows me, often sees me playing words with friends and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNNzRyd1xz0">Angry Birds</a> on my iPhone-- In fact I kinda remember wanting a Nintendo DS or a Sony PSP before getting my iPhone last year, but since that time, the games have gotten better and a lot more interesting.<br /><br />But lets talk about another app category...  Musical instruments. It seems that nice touch panel is precise enough, the internal bits quick enough, and of course the speakers are loud enough for you to totally replace that <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/filippovancini/2875572884/">Stratocaster</a> or that <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/roll_initiative/3305595324/">Korg</a> with an iPhone app...  Don't believe me?
