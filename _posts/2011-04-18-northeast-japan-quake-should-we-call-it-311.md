<p style="text-align: center;">[youtube]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vZR0Rq1Rfw[/youtube]</p><br /><br /><address>Cellphone video from South Sanriku Town captures an entire town reduced to rubble in 5 minutes.</address> <address>via <a title="YouTube" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vZR0Rq1Rfw&feature=player_embedded" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.</address> <br /><br /> <br /><br />Just over one month ago, we had a magnitude 9.0 earthquake strike off the coast of Northeastern Japan.  Today, as if to say "never forget", we had a major M7.1 aftershock hit south and west of that area.  Shaking was well-felt here; but due to technology, everyone knew it was coming...  So again, I'm gonna recommend these apps for your smartphone.<br /><br /> <br /><br />iPhone users, get <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/yurekuru-call-for-iphone/id398954883" target="_blank">Yurekuru</a>.<br /><br />Android users, get <a href="http://www.appbrain.com/app/namazu-alert/jp.twiple.android.quake" target="_blank">Namazu</a>.<br /><br />Just knowing i have a 10~60 second window on an incoming shaker is enough to let me sleep at night.<br /><br />And while I don't live close enough to the sea to worry about a tsunami, Just seeing this scares the living $#!+ outta me. I saw with my own eyes the destruction of Hurricane Katrina, but this tops all that.<br /><br />[wikibox lang="en"]Hurricane Katrina[/wikibox]
