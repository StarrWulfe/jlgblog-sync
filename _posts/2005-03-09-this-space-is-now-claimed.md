><img src="http://jlgatewood.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/j7atwork.jpg" /><br /><br />I am... I was... I will be.. These are questions that I have asked and am still asking myself. As I find the answers out, so will you. If you think I am right, then rejoice in our agreement. If you think I am wrong then feel free to voice that too, just don't expect me to change <span style="font-style: italic;">my</span> outcome to suit your tastes and opinions...  But like I said, I will listen to them!<br /><br />In the coming days, I will be posting a little about myself, and my musings on my little view on the world and society...<br /><br />My aim is not to make a change in the grand scheme of things, but just to impress my voice and thoughts to the public-at-large... Hopefully with things like Google, Yahoo and more, my blog will outlive me, and this will become a digital testament to the universe that I even existed for a small slice of the infinium...
