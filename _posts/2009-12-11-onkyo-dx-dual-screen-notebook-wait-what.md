Sure, it's just a rebadge of the Japanese Kohjinsha DZ-series dual-display rig we've already seen. But Onkyo's DX raises the bar significantly by delivering a pair of 10.1-inch 1,366 × 768 pixel LCD displays (as promised at CEATEC) that easily trump the 1,024 x 600 panels used on the Kohjinsha without increasing the portable's overall size. While we're still looking at the same 1.6GHz Athlon Neo MV-40 CPU, ATI Radeon HD 3200 graphics, 802.11n WiFi, Bluetooth 2.1 + EDR, and 3x USB jacks, Oknyo's offering starts with 2GB (not 1GB) of memory standard expandable to 4GB, a 320GB 5,400rpm disk (not 160GB), Gigabit Ethernet, and 32-bit Windows 7 Home Premium. Here's the best part: it's priced at just ¥84,800 (about $966) compared to the Kohjinsha which lists for ¥79,800 / $909 on Kohjinsha's retail site or a steep ¥100,800 / $1,148 premium if purchased through the GeekStuff4u exporter. Guess which one we'd choose?<br /></div><a href="http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&ie=UTF8&langpair=ja%7Cen&sl=ru&tl=en&u=http://pc.watch.impress.co.jp/docs/news/20091210_334159.html">Via PC Impress Japan</a><br /></blockquote><br />Did I mention I ♥ Japan??<br />Goin' to Osu tomorrow to see this puppy up close...  Can you say Mobile Webcasting and Editing Rig? If totally loaded up with that 4gigs of RAM and stick in a 500Gig HDD...  Yup, it's on.<br /><div style="font-size: 9px;">Posted via web by J7  <br /></div>
