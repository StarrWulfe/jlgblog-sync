The best of American and Japanese drifting teams  put their cars sideways on the track, and I of course put my car in the pits to show off with my car club...  But how I wish I had all-wheel drive!  Ever seen an xB get sideways?  Want to?<br /><br />My last car was a BMW E28 M5, I would practice drifting with some friends in St Louis-- 3 of which were from Japan, and were actually doing this when it was still unknown outside of the mountainsides of that country.  I thought it was just a cool way to make a turn, but if I had known it would blow up into a sport here, I would have kept that car!  But then again, I got tired of replacing parts and sealing leaks...  I may however find an old 240, or re-build my beloved supra and try my hand at drifting...  Who knows, I may find myself on the same track as Steve Millen one day....<br /></div></div>
