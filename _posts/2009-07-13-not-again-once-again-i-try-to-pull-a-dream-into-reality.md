>Sorry for the lack of updates in the last few weeks readers-- I've been busy.  Recently while contemplating my own selfish and sometimes foolish reason for being in Japan, I remembered that I am here to first and foremost have a set of experiences that I wouldn't otherwise be able to, or at the most have a hard time experiencing back in my own country for various reasons.  For a long long looooooong time I often wondered why it was so hard for me to work in my chosen field, mass communications...  I went to school to study it <u>twice</u> even--just in case I missed something the first time...  But alas-- it seems whenever I land a job in the fifth estate, I end up getting laid off, pushed into another department, or my contract simply doesn't get renewed.  I guess it's me-- I'm a creative type to be sure, but definitely NOT a corporate suit. Hell, I hate wearing neckties to church (the few times a year you actually catch me in a church--that's a whole 'nother conversation...)  Basically what I'm saying is, I work hard for what I believe in, and the nanosecond that I feel my hard work isn't being appreciated, or worse, being taken for granted ,or even worse still, being taken advantage of--  I start acting really bitchy and let my feelings be heard, seen and felt.   So it's no surprise that I'm not really trying to work in some faceless corporation's PR unit...  I just don't fit in.<br /><br />Ok so back to me being in Japan. Of course I came back here 9 months ago to just ESCAPE my boring-ass, monotonous, monotone, any-other-boring-sounding-adjective-goes-here life.  Check the back issues of the blog from last year to see what I mean-- just look on the right side in 2008 and you'll see what I mean.  Anyway I came here I guess to recapture some of my good vibes...  and see if I could make my one chance to do something seemingly impossible (for me anyway) possible...  To be a success somehow doing something I love, in the place that I love.  No secret, I love Japan... even with all it's idiosyncrasies, irritations, inconviences, and other words that start with "i", I still gots love for this place.  But I want more.  I'm selfish that way.  In the same manner I like to blog, I want EVERYONE to feel the same feeling at least for 5 seconds, that I do...  Yep, I know, I am a tad narcissistic.  There, I said it, happy now?   So with these self-serving reasons in mind, I've banded together with 4 other like-minded folks here in Nagoya and created a new magazine-- RAN Magazine.<br /><br /><br />So what exactly is this rag we've slapped together?  Well its kind of a conglomeration of all the foreign voices here in this city--  If you live in Nagoya and you're not Japanese, and have been here long enough for the shine to wear thin, then I don't have to explain...  But to the others:<br /><br /><img src="http://www.jlgatewood.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/nameran%20logo.gif" /><br /><i>We want to expose you to things that exist, even if<br />they aren't so P.C.. We're not trying to be politically<br />correct, we're trying to be useful and informative,<br />even entertaining. Life isn't perfect, neither are we. Not<br />everything is funny or cute, but some things are. We hope<br />we can show you some of both. And, we want you to let<br />us know what you like, what you think, how you feel and<br />what's on your mind.<br />We hope RAN will be a truly multicultural piece of work.<br />We hope it will be a "bulletin board" of ideas, events,<br />and opinions, expressions and thoughts from a wide<br />variety of people. The racial boundaries of yesterday are<br />dissolving before our eyes, but traditions die hard.<br />RAN hopes to shed light in dark places. We want<br />to connect people in order to build a society of people<br />looking forward with hope and optimism—<br />based on what we've learned, and are still learning—a true<br />community of open-minded people.<br />We're into music, food, sports, fashion, politics, humor,<br />culture, spirituality, relationships, shopping, travel, language,<br />adventure, friendship, community, and more. We're not<br />into hate, but if you are a hater, send us your feelings and<br />comments. We'll talk about them.<br />RAN is about healing and progress. Let the dead bury<br />the dead. We're into the future...<br />It's about the society we're building, not the one that's<br />falling apart. But we've got to learn about what we've done<br />wrong to be able to do it better. Society is at stake. It's our<br />"family" outside of our homes. Everything is connected.</i><br /><br />So I invite everyone that is a part of my world-- whether you're in my machi or back in the states, or wherever in the world you've happen to be-- I invite you to follow me on this journey here with this new magazine.  As editor-at-large, I am responsible for making sure all the contributors and collaborators are doing their tasks accordingly and also from a technical standpoint, make sure the grammar, written style, and continuity is in check--  I also tend to write 2-3 articles per issue too...  I am also in charge of the online presence, so check out <a href="http://www.ranmagazine.com/">www.ranmagazine.com</a> in the next week or so-- we release the magazine in print form bi-monthly, but we want to build an online community, so as articles get done, they'll have their own discussion forums tagged to them--in this manner I hope we can tie our communities together.  Also while I am on this subject, I want to make it clear that it's also my intention to make a Japanese companion site in the near future too--It's not fair for the English readers to have the ability to flame our pants off, without the Japanese readers not being able to take part!<br /><br />Sorry for being long-winded this time ya'll-- but I hope you understand why I've been incommunicado lately....  Love and Peace as always!<br /><img src="file:/C%3A/Users/J7/AppData/Local/Temp/moz-screenshot.png" alt="" /><img src="file:/C%3A/Users/J7/AppData/Local/Temp/moz-screenshot-1.png" alt="" /><br /><br />BTW-- StreetSide Media is STILL going strong-- I'm using the name as a freelancer for now with websites and multimedia here--stay tuned for some new developments with that, and yeah RAN is a part of the family...  <a href="http://www.streetsidemedia.com/">www.streetsidemedia.com</a><br /><a title="View Foreword p2 June18 on Scribd" href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/17300835/Foreword-p2-June18" style="margin: 12px auto 6px; font-family: Helvetica,Arial,Sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 14px; line-height: normal; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal; display: block; text-decoration: underline;">Foreword p2 June18</a> <object codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=9,0,0,0" id="doc_126763559499492" name="doc_126763559499492" class width="100%" align="middle" height="500">  <param name="movie" value="http://d.scribd.com/ScribdViewer.swf?document_id=17300835&access_key=key-1kho0sm8gcqw2ex5rbf1&page=1&version=1&viewMode=">   </param><param name="quality" value="high">   </param><param name="play" value="true">  </param><param name="loop" value="true">   </param><param name="scale" value="showall">  </param><param name="wmode" value="opaque">   </param><param name="devicefont" value="false">  </param><param name="bgcolor" value="#ffffff">   </param><param name="menu" value="true">  </param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true">   </param><param name="allowScriptAccess" value="always">   </param><param name="salign" value="">        <embed src="http://d.scribd.com/ScribdViewer.swf?document_id=17300835&access_key=key-1kho0sm8gcqw2ex5rbf1&page=1&version=1&viewMode=" quality="high" pluginspage="http://www.macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer" play="true" loop="true" scale="showall" wmode="opaque" devicefont="false" bgcolor="#ffffff" name="doc_126763559499492_object" menu="true" allowfullscreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" salign="" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="100%" align="middle" height="500"></embed> </param></object> <br /><a href="http://www.streetsidemedia.com/">www.streetsidemedia.com</a> | <a href="http://www.ranmagazine.com/">www.ranmagazine.com</a>
