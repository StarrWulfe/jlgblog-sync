Last year, I wanted to teach the kids at the school I used to work at in Nagoya about Dr Martin Luther King Jr, and how the civil rights movement in America sparked similar movements around the world. Even to this day we can trace the ongoing movements in the Middle East for example, to what started as a bus boycott in Montgomery, Alabama so many years ago.<br /><br />I also noted that Dr King is from my 2nd hometown, Atlanta, Georgia, and there we have so many symbols of his legacy. I played the famous "I Have a Dream" speech, and also gave out translated copies in Japanese. Then I showed some video I shot of the MLK Center in Atlanta along with this slide show.<br /><br /><br /><br />Happy Birthday Dr King, without you, I wouldn't be here in Japan for sure. Thank you.<br /><br /><img class="alignnone" src="https://blob-s-docs.googlegroups.com/docs/OgAAANjpjiL7DaO6cuH03LEvQPxI3jBvguF7x0M7MVokPL_ZhBEc9TMjERo7KqhZMJTEwMzCw9gWvIgrr0-aADLeuUQA15jOjAfoWrtl2Q6E50iWk5chlNHgqVqs" alt="" width="1" height="1" />
