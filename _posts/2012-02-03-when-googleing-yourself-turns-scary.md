<img class="alignright" style="margin: 3px;" src="http://www.outrider.com.au/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Scary-Google.jpg" alt="" width="255" height="253" /><br /><br />I have a strange habit of checking Google for my name and handle every month or so, just to see what other people can learn about me on the internet (and whether or not that stuff is something I want others to see or not, more importantly)<br /><br />Today I did just that, and found out that somewhere on the south side of Chicago in the US, there was another man named Jason Gatewood; <a href="http://chicago.cbslocal.com/2012/01/15/man-dies-after-being-shot-in-south-shore/">he was found in a yard, dead from multiple gunshots</a>. My heart and prayers go out to the family of the Chicago Jason; he had a mother and a father at least--and maybe a kid and a significant other.<br /><br />Chilling and sobering, when someone who has the same exact name as you (and probably ethnicity given that part of Chicago) dies in such a violent way and its posted all over the internet... Chilling to think someday, my death will be also in the internet's archive too...<br /><br />At any rate, <em>THIS</em> Jason Gatewood is alive and well in Yokohama, Japan.<br /><br /> <br /><blockquote><a href="http://chicago.cbslocal.com/2012/01/15/man-dies-after-being-shot-in-south-shore/">Man Dies After Being Shot In South Shore</a> --from WBBM CBS Chicago<br /><br /><img class="alignleft" src="http://images0-focus-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?container=focus&gadget=a&resize_h=100&url=http%3A%2F%2Fcbschicago.files.wordpress.com%2F2010%2F12%2Fshooting_generic_1208.jpg%3Fw%3D300" alt="" />A man died Saturday afternoon after he was found lying in a yard with multiple gunshot wounds in the South Side South Shore neighborhood.</blockquote>
