I just spent the last 5 hours dealing with the Japanese bureaucracy that is the Department of Driver's Services (運転免許試験局) to get my license renewed (運転免許証の更新)... Of course you remember the last time I dealt with them was 3 years ago getting the license here to begin with... Remember the <em>JOY</em> I found in what amounted to playing Mario Kart with a decommissioned taxi for 2 weeks... If not, <a title="Instances of efficiency and inefficiency here in Japan…" href="http://www.jlgatewood.com/2009/03/instances-of-efficiency-and-inefficiency-here-in-japan.html/" target="_blank">look here</a>.<br /><br />[caption id="" align="alignleft" width="315" caption="...this ain&#039;t me by the way..."]<img src="http://www.jlgatewood.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/5967085.jpg" alt="" width="315" height="211" />[/caption]<br /><br />Basically, today I spent ¥4250 to get a 2 hour lecture on why you shouldn't drink and drive (飲酒運転), looking for pedestrians at night (夜間の歩行者を探し), and not to scare older drivers on the road (高齢運転者マークの意味.)<br /><br />All of this was in Japanese and required my full JLPT level 2 knowledge because I had to write some quiz later in the class.<br />There's gotta be an English version of this somewhere, right?  As far as I know, NOPE.  Not that I asked really-- my Japanese skills are doable for stuff like this, but what about the others who are living here and barely read/write kana, let alone maybe basic kanji...  I feel for you guys...
