But I do believe in a higher power, and whether you call it Allah, Jesus, Jehovah, or whatever, I call it my inner sanctum.<br /><br />Despite what others may say, I'm in church EVERYDAY, because my God is EVERYWHERE, and present in EVERYTHING.<br /><br />Family and Friends back home, and here-- near and far.... And especially mama, pops, granny and granddad...  I'm working hard to make sure everything you've given and sacrificed isn't wasted. Even though I am not there to share in the upcoming thanksgiving holiday, I give thanks every MOMENT for all that y'all have done and continue to do for me.  I try my hardest to pass that spirit on to everyone I come across.<br /><br />For those who don't know, I sang this song one Easter Sunday at Mt Gideon Baptist Church in St. Louis, Missouri, my hometown.  I think I was 10 years old... My cousin Shannon and I were in the youth choir and we sang this...  I remember feeling a power when I sang this... Since then, this is the song I sing sometimes when I need to remember where I came from. I remember my mom and grandparents in the audience....  My aunts, uncles, other cousins and brother...  I remember all our neighbors were there too... And I remember having a huge dinner that night with my whole family.<br /><br />So when you feel off-center...  Remember where you started from, and who was around to carry you through. Remember that spirit.  And work with that power...  Some call it religon, some call it inner strength.  You can call it whatever... I don't need to give it a name; it already knows mine, and that's enough for me.<br /><br /><img src="http://www.jlgatewood.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/hqdefault1.jpg" width="1" height="1" />
