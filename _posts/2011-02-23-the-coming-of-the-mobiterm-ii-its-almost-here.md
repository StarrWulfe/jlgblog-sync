<img class="alignleft" style="margin-right: 4px; margin-left: 4px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 6px;" src="http://www.jlgatewood.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Atrix4G2.jpg" alt="" width="385" height="331" align="left" /><br /><br />About 6 years ago, I wrote a column that talked about what the cellphone of the future would be.  If you haven't seen it, don't worry--It's still hanging out on the internets right here → <a href="http://www.jlgatewood.com/2005/10/futuretrek-the-coming-of-the-mobiterm.html/" target="_self">http://www.jlgatewood.com/2005/10/futuretrek-the-coming-of-the-mobiterm.html/</a><br /><br />See in 2005, there were no iPhones, no Android phones...  No 3G, 4G data... no WiMAX, LTE, or anything of that nature... You'd be lucky to pull down 100-200 Kps on a mobilephone or USB dongle, and even luckier to find a WiFi hotspot to link up to and use. These days though, I have a phone that rivals my FIBER internet connection at times. I have tons of apps that let me do just about EVERYTHING I can do on my MacBook Pro, as far as consuming internet content is concerned (I still need the MBP to CREATE content however ;))<br /><br />On a typical day I must use my phone about a good 3 hours or so... and I thing only 10% of that time is spent actually TALKING on it.  It's my map, guidebook, travelog, camera, newspaper, TV, walkie-talkie, radio, ATM, business card, and video game center.  It has literally SAVED MY LIFE a half-dozen times or more too, I'm sure.  It's the de-facto #1 device in my little world. If I had to choose to keep just one piece of tech, My iPhone would be the one.<br /><br />When I wrote that article in 2005, I knew we'd get there sooner or later... And with the release of a few more devices, we'll be there.  We will reach the day when your MobiTerm is the only device you'll really need to interface with, and it's coming quicker and gonna be better than I imagined... All because of one development I didn't forsee... The Cloud.<br /><br />The cloud refers to the internet as a whole.  And if you've been using the 'net in the last 3 years, you've no doubt put your pictures on Facebook or Flicker, some video on YouTube, listened to some music from SoundCloud, and wrote your last resume in Google Docs (at least I did.)  The cloud is where it's at in terms of keeping all your files in one place and not having to think about what USB stick is my presentation on, or did I remember to email those pictures of my new apartment to my parents back home?  Since 2008, I have been living life in the clouds...  Like so many of life's paradigm shifts, I was forced into it...<br /><br />When I moved to Japan in 2008, I toted along my 1 1/2 year old HP mid-grade laptop. One day, while doing something as benign as editing a Word doc, my computer froze and the screen went all mozaic on me; then blacked out, never to be turned on ever again...  I was working on a worksheet for a class I was going to teach later that day (I worked as a JHS English Teacher) and was really up a creek... Until I realized I was working in Google Docs at the time, and maybe it saved a backup.  I went to one of the school's computer and logged in and looked for it... Sure enough, it was saved, and I began where I left off.  So when I finally replaced my laptop, I went Mac, and I went Cloud.  I need the performace of the Mac to make videos, code HTML and PHP, do graphics in Photoshop and Illustrator, and even try to make apps for iOS and Android (and I need it to JAILBREAK my iPhone!) But for everything ELSE-- I live in the cloud.<br /><br />My wonderous imaginary scene I painted back in 2005 is almost a reality now because of this, and there is one device that is halfway bringing this fantasy into being. The Motorola Atrix 4G.  It's a very powerful Android OS phone that also slips into a dock and becomes a full-fledged laptop replacement, a webterminal for your desktop, GPS and car entertainment system or a home entertainment system.  Check out the promo video below.<br /><br />http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4gpOQDcn7c<br /><br />When I saw this concept debut at CES this year, I thought "Damn... someone from Motorola read my post and owes me MONEY!"  They got the concept almost perfect for me.  What's missing though?  The merging of the phone's OS and the webtop OS...  I'm not worried though, because in this case, Motorola's support of Android is perfect since Google makes the OS.  They also are working on another project...  Called ChromeOS... and it's PERFECT for what I'm talking about...  Check this out!<br /><br />http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANMrzw7JFzA<br /><br />Now some people have railed against this concept, mostly paranoid about what would happen if there was no internet available? how would you get to your stuff?  In my case, the MobiTerm is connected 95% of the time, because its still a PHONE. the onboard 4G will make sure you're connected. and if not-- there's memory there along with microSD. And it autosyncs to make sure you're data is safe in the cloud at the earliest opportunity.<br /><br />Ok, we got the PC paradigm covered... What about some home entertainment?  Well Google is working on that one too, with something called GoogleTV. Think YouTube+Internet+Hulu+Netflix+your-big-ass-HDTV.  Again, video speaks louder than words, so...<br /><br />http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS0la9SmqWA<br /><br />Wow. All the pieces are in place... So what I'm asking for is some way to COMBINE them...  A super phone.
