Just as I was thinking I wanted to combine my sites into one on JLGatewood.com and also figure out a way to have one theme in WordPress serve mobiles as well as PC browsers, along comes this.  Check out my site now!<br />Still working on the theme, but anything from a smartphone to an HD monitor will be able to see it as I intended thanks to the responsive HTML5 coding I used.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.webresourcesdepot.com/34-free-wordpress-theme-frameworks-and-starter-themes-with-a-comparison-chart/">34 Free WordPress Theme Frameworks and Starter Themes (With A Comparison Chart)</a><br /><br /><img src="http://images0-focus-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?container=focus&gadget=a&resize_h=100&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.webresourcesdepot.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fwordpress_theme_frameworks.jpg" class="alignleft" />Free Web Resources Everyday - WebResourcesDepot
