>I'm sitting in the control room looking at Rosa Parks funeral right now, and I am still in awe of how this one soft-spoken lady started a revolution.  But that revolution didn't just dtop here; people all over the world know about Rosa Parks.<br /><br /><br />I just hope we all can understand that we have rights and liberties here that someone had to stand up (and sit down) for.  The struggle may not be as in-your-face now, but issues like biggotry, classism, and racism still are around.  We must honor those that started the fight for our rights by continuing to be vigilant.  Our civil rights movement was not only a victory for us here in this country, but after speaking with others around the world, it was and is continued to be used as a model for human rights struggles around the world.  Rememeber that most African, Latin American, and Caribbean nations fought for their independence right after we got rid of segregation...  They saw what our mothers and fathers did, and wanted the same freedoms!  <br /><br /><br />Remember, if you don't stand for something, you'll fall for anything.
